My husband and I had to watch this after watching the Bette and Joan special on TV recently.  I'm not sure the younger generation will enjoy it as much as those of us who remember these actors.,1493424000,"04 29, 2017",5.0,1
loved it.  It is great.,1475107200,"09 29, 2016",5.0,1

This season is also filled with energy-packed scenes and good storytelling combined.  Kiefer Sutherland is a superb actor in this series.,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",5.0,1
"This is not my favorite movie either.  After seeing the remake of The Italian Job, I wanted to get the original, but was not impressed with it.  I like the actors alright, but wasn't that pleased with the story itself.  Okay movie, and great service with Amazon as usual.",1370044800,"06 1, 2013",3.0,0
Excellent,1435536000,"06 29, 2015",5.0,1
A very well acted old Russian movie. Set in the days of the Great Patriotic War (WW2) it gives you a look into the lives of those that stayed home and waited. A very good but ad movie.,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",4.0,1
"Great film. Watching in Blu-ray 3D, even greater. You can almost believe that the actors were riding creatures that fly.",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",5.0,1
Good movie with great character building.  The actors did a great job.  I especially liked seeing the relationship grow between the brothers.,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",4.0,1

"They're flip disks, plus their stupid ""Universal"" theme song for ""Universal Pictures"" or whatever that is, it's after every stupid episode.  It's ridiculous....",1483574400,"01 5, 2017",3.0,0
Kind of slow for an hbo series. Interesting though.,1430352000,"04 30, 2015",3.0,0
"A complete waste of my time. Stupid and boring. Aliens fans will probably like it, but it's just too stupid to find any redeeming value in it. Good actors, at least there's that.",1495238400,"05 20, 2017",1.0,-1
"What a fun movie!  Well done!  Excellent cast, all the actors looked as if they were having a marvelous time on set!  Love the *Jane* character!!  CGI scenes were really good!  Thoroughly enjoyable movie!!",1490400000,"03 25, 2017",5.0,1

Really not much new.  Most of the characters are the same as every year.  Most of the stories are the same.  Needs to have NEW blood.,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",3.0,0

One of the greatest anime films of all time in a cool metal case. Everything worked fine and came in good condition.,1519344000,"02 23, 2018",5.0,1
I read the other reviews and decided we would watch this for our family night.... not impressed. If this was suppose to be as good as Overboard it is a complete failure. I love all the actors but the story line was super weak and not family friendly at all. Don't bother!,1455321600,"02 13, 2016",1.0,-1
Was one of my favorites when I was a kid.  It was the first to have a 90 minute format.  Lots of drama and comedy!  There are conversations with some of the actors as extras to this collection.,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",5.0,1
The movie was a good movie especially with Robert DeNiro in the lead role.  He is one of my favorite actors.,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",4.0,1
This was an Ok movie.  Some great twists.  Kind of went south with the special unit.  The ending did save it a little bit.  Maybe a sequel?,1419552000,"12 26, 2014",3.0,0

"Brad Pitt's best movie, in my humble opinion. I love watching this flick, it's one that gets better with repeat viewing. It's taken me a while to figure out most of what's being said due to the very strong accents but that's part of the charm. It's a really fun flick done by some of the best actors for the genre - a really enjoyable film.",1463270400,"05 15, 2016",5.0,1
"This is supposedly being restored for Bluray 3D....I watched it with that in mind- a silly 50's Sci-Fi film, but a bit entertaining.",1425945600,"03 10, 2015",2.0,-1

"Started off very interesting and had some funny moments, but was still missing something.  The main issue is trying to have a comedy and horror movie at the same time cant really be done.  It's just to weird and doesn't help advance the plot or the characters.",1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2.0,-1

"The premise of this movie was the most interesting thing about it. A man obsessed with a life apart. Good sci-fi, but a disappointing ending, in my opinion. It's like they ran out of ideas.... or money... at the end.",1432080000,"05 20, 2015",3.0,0

"That was awful. Keep an eye on that Director so you'll know to avoid future work. No character development whatsoever. I wasn't rooting for anybody. The ridiculously large alien at the end was so over the top that it made me start hoping for a ""final solution"" ending. No even going to think about seeing another sequel.",1476662400,"10 17, 2016",1.0,-1
"I know that title is over used but this movie is awesome.  The actors are great, the story is great--the outcome of the battle is sad but is known.I have waited a long time for Amazon to have this movie available to purchase.

I have seen it before, many many times but never get tired of it.This movie is not a disappointment--at least not for me",1392854400,"02 20, 2014",5.0,1

"I actually love this.I acknowledge this isn't a great film, and it possesses none of the greatness and novelty of the first film, but it was infinitely better than the first film.The goal was to introduce more dinosaurs, and in that, the film succeeded.  I loved watching new dinosaurs, no matter how brief.I found this film to be more intriguing, more interesting, and more enjoyable film than the second film.  This film was good on its own.  The human characters were interesting, and I enjoyed the story.I love it when it come on reruns.",1458604800,"03 22, 2016",3.0,0

"Cool concept but could have lived with out seeing it.  Boring and not the best acting.  Documentary style movies like this are not my favorite as they are jarring, confusing and take away from some important scenes at times.  Overall not one I would recommend.",1421366400,"01 16, 2015",2.0,-1

Good movie not as funny as I thought it was gonna be. Worth watching if you are already a Trailer Park Boys fan. Or like independent movies no big special effects just a decent movie worth watching if you having seen it already.,1415404800,"11 8, 2014",3.0,0

"I thought it would be more interesting than it was. Between poor acting and missing what could have been a descent story line they dropped the ball. There are some attractive ladies who don't act very well and do show some breasts once in awhile, but don't make up for a bad show.",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2.0,-1
"This is a very unusual movie...not one I would normally choose.  I can't even really say why I watched it.  It was pretty slow going at first and normally that would have earned it a quick cut-off from my watching, but I guess it was the topic that was strange enough to keep me watching.  In the end, there was empathy for the main character and a sort of redemption of ""human nature"".  I'm still thinking about it on occasion so that says something.....",1446422400,"11 2, 2015",3.0,0

"I wasn't sure if this movie would stand up to the test of time. We haven't seen it for years, but it was always one of my husbands ""favorites"". I remember seeing it with him, at a drive-in theater, when we were dating! We still enjoyed it (my god, almost 40 years later!), although I'm sure nostalgia was a big factor for us. The DVD quality is reasonable for a 70's movie. We haven't listened to the commentary yet, but look forward to watching all the special features.",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",4.0,1
"WHAT A FUNNY MOVIE!  I love both of these actors anyway, and Ryan Reynolds is one of my very favorite.  He always delivers. He is a single fun loving guy and his friend is married with twins.  They wish for each others lives and .....guess what?",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",5.0,1
"This movie is point blank awful. It has no story line, no character you can connect with. No story, no middle, a goofy end. It was one of the worst movies I ever watched!!",1453680000,"01 25, 2016",1.0,-1

Movie with a good message--what do we want to focus on and how our lives and others can be improved when we decide to help others.  Definitely a Christian movie with a great Christmas theme.,1449964800,"12 13, 2015",3.0,0

This movie seems to be a simple movie...BUT WOW... extremely thought provoking.  I gladly got another one for a friend.  I also got the sequel to see if it is as good. I love the actors too...'less is MORE' in this movie,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",5.0,1

"This movie starts out very interesting and promising, but falls apart very quick.  I didn't like all the flashbacks sequences they did because it was trying to make you feel like they were trying to explain to you about what was going on thinking you couldn't follow it.  If you're going to get all these really good actors together then you need a better story.  This movie has a  little action, but not really that much like you might think by looking at the cover or reading the synopsis on the back.  I don't recommend this to anybody.",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",1.0,-1
this movie is a sweet movie to watch...the actors all do a good job.  I bought this dvd as a gift for my sister in law...she enjoyed it.  Hallmark movies are my type of entertainment.,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",5.0,1

"The acting is okay, the script is decent, don't expect too much from this movie because you will be disappointed.  I started watching this with zero expectations, which is probably why it has three stars instead of two. I liked the lead, she was very convincing, i just wish she had a better script to work with. The entire movie is enjoyable, but don't expect to find out the exact reasons why, or what exactly is wrong with her. That's something i usually want in a movie about someone seeking revenge, i want a bit more of an explanation, but that's fine, we can show various horse scenes instead.",1456704000,"02 29, 2016",3.0,0

I know this was based on the book called Truth....  but it wasn't about truth at all.  They didn't lose their jobs because they were telling the truth they lost them because they ignored the truth  and wanted to create a story, not report it.",1458000000,"03 15, 2016",2.0,-1

This movie was supposed to be awesome; the best time travel/science fiction movie in a long time.  I thought it was merely an ok action flick.  I hated the make-up they put on Joseph Gordon-Levitt; I found it very distracting and completely unnecessary.,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",3.0,0

It was difficult to believe that anyone--I'm talking about ""the idiot brother,"" Ned--could be that naive, but I was willing to go along with it for the first 3/4 of the movie. I got caught up in the turn around though. I just couldn't go for it. Like any other movie, the characters all have their own particular points of view, and generally, there's a ""turn around moment,"" often the climax, where their point of view changes. So anyway, I found that moment in this movie to be lame which made the end of the movie rather unsatisfying.But it was fun overall.

As it progressed, I had hoped it would live up to that. Sadly it didn't. The acting was fair, but the girl's parents (and other people) didn't act like compassionate normal human beings. I could understand being angry at the guy who got their daughter pregnant, but in real life, you would at least talk to him and try to get to know him, -for the sake of the child. No humanity in these people though. As in many cases, I might attempt to give it two stars; but I need to knock it down to reality.

"Shot in colour and released in 1957, ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" is, of course, the film that made Hammer Films a household name for horror/thriller movie fans all over the world. To fully appreciate the importance and impact of ""Curse"", you have to look at it in the context of the time when it was made. By the mid-fifties, horror films had long passed their peak in Hollywood--certainly in terms of quality. Black and white ""quickies"", with almost no budget, were being churned out for teenagers to watch at the drive-in ( at least, those who were watching the screen ! ) Shlock-masters like Roger Corman and Bert Gordon were turning out ""masterpieces"" like ""The Wasp Woman"" and ""The Amazing Colossal Man"".Suddenly, we have a small studio in England, making a horror film with excellent production values, gorgeously creepy sets, fine costumes, professional actors and a talented director, Terence Fisher. At the same time, along with a classy look, you add liberal amounts of gore ( certainly by 1950s standards ), and a couple of voluptuous ""damsels in distress"" who can scream lustily when they encounter the monster. It was a winning formula that Hammer would raise to an art form.Peter Cushing plays Baron Von Frankenstein, and his terrific performance dominates the film. His character goes through quite a transformation from curious scientist to an obsessive fiend, determined to ""create life"" at, literally, any cost. His mentor/friend Paul Krempe ( Robert Urquhart )is an enthusiastic assistant at first, but soon becomes alienated by the Baron's frantic and ultimately murderous behaviour. Sometimes body parts are easily available--sometimes you have to be ""creative"" in obtaining them !Of course, this flesh and blood ""jigsaw puzzle"" comes to life in the form of a hideous, pathetic creature played by Christopher Lee, who soon breaks loose, displaying no appreciation whatsoever for being ""born"" ! As I mentioned earlier, two beautiful women ""round out"" the cast. Gorgeous Hazel Court is Elizabeth, the Baron's betrothed, and Valerie Gaunt is Justine the maid. Justine is, as they say in England, the Baron's ""bit on the side""--when she threatens to spill all the Baron's secrets unless he marries her, you just know that her future is ""cloudy"".""Curse"" may not be Hammer's best film, but it put the studio on the map and started an enduring partnership of two very fine actors--Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.The DVD exhibits good colour, with occasional haziness and mono sound. The extras are sparse--a few notes on other Hammer films, and a trailer. I would have loved some comments from Mr. Lee--sadly Peter Cushing passed away some time ago.Still, if you like classic horror films, ""Curse"" has to be in your collection--its importance cannot be over-estimated. Recommended.A very sad footnote, dated 30 April 2008. Ms. Hazel Court has passed away at age 82. She was most famous for her roles in horror/suspense films produced by the Hammer Studios and also Roger Corman. A talented actress, she always brought glamour and a touch of class to any production she was involved in.",1087430400,"06 17, 2004",4.0,1

"I first heard about Juno when I read about its popularity at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival. The story, upon first read, about a smart-ass teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with the challenge of how to handle it, did not impress me. It wasn't a storyline that captivated my imagination or my intellectual curiosity. So I wondered. Why did this film keep receiving adulation from just about every movie reviewer under the sun? Rotten Tomatoes had a multitude of positive reviews with a few negatives ones sprinkled in. I decided I wasn't going to fall for the media circus surrounding this picture and would wait for it to come out on DVD.Now I have written screenplays before so I believe I can be quite critical from a screenwriter's standpoint given that I know what is involved when crafting a screenplay. Let's first review the movie:Juno tells the story of a 16 year old girl, sarcastic, smart and a bit too cocky for her own good as she finds out right at the start of the film that she is pregnant after having casual sex with her highschool boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker. Once Juno finds that she's pregnant, she informs her best girlfriend and they discuss what exactly she should do. Juno then breaks the news to her parents. Her parents give her the OK for an abortion ( a tad too cavalier in my opinion). Juno attempts the abortion route but gets cold feet. She then decides to give her baby up for adoption. She places an ad in the local paper and identifies a lovely wealthy couple who want to adopt. Will things go smoothly for Juno? How will she respond once she gives birth?For starters, this basic plot outline doesn't do much for me. I'm not intrigued by it and my curiosity has not been peaked. If I read the logline of this script it would not be one of my first reads. But let's begin to analyze this picture.Now I realize that each and every family on this planet is different. Parents are not the same all over when it comes to their emotional reactions. Juno's parents know very well the sharp-tongued verbal antics of their daughter (mother shown is actually step-mother to Juno) so one would take that into consideration. However, the reaction by both parents to Juno's admission of pregnancy is so calculated and without serious emotion that it begs the question, what kinds of parents are these people and would they actually exist in real life or are they just a caricature created by screenwriter Diablo Cody? One has to seriously ask this question because once Juno decides to initially opt for abortion wouldn't she at least bring one of her parents to go with her? Juno ends up visiting the abortion clinic alone! What kind of parent would send their teenager alone to an abortion clinic to get an abortion? It begs all credulity! I bring this up because it strikes at the very premise of Diablo Cody's smartly penned dialogue. These characters are indeed fictitious with not a shred of relevance to an actual family faced with the challenge of raising a ""know it all"" teenager.Once Juno enters the abortion clinic, the director tries to show how uncomfortable Juno is inside it by focusing on strange sounds the various people are making inside, (i.e. such as nail filing). The woman at the abortion clinic front desk appears to incongruous to say the least. No abortion clinic I've ever heard about or visited would ever feature such a character at the front desk. Again, this character was created by Diablo as a way to entertain the audience but at the same time ""creep"" Juno out from actually having an abortion.Let's discuss Juno's boyfriend, played by Michael Cera. The on-screen chemistry between Michael and Ellen Page (who plays Juno) is good but nothing to write home about. This is mainly due to the meekness of Michael Cera's character. They are such opposites that again, it strains credulity to think that a sarcastic ""know it all"" like Juno would be attracted to such an introvert like Michael Cera's character. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but Michael's character is bland, boring and dull.The two parents who consider adopting Juno's child, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are played well and I don't have any real criticism for either character. Both actors perform well and the twist that Diablo Cody includes in their relationship provides for the drama that occurs later.I've come to the conclusion that the reason why this film gained such popularity is two: People were delightfully stunned by the crisp, back and forth repartee between characters (courtesy of Diablo Cody's sharply penned dialogue); the overall fine acting by all of the cast; and finally, audiences like movies where everything is taken into account and there are no serious questions left to ponder. Juno nicely wraps up by the end of the film and you're left with nothing more to ruminate on. At least I didn't.But as a screenwriter, I'm here to tell you that in cinema, if you want respect from a screenwriter, you've got to inject some plausibility into your screenplay! (Unless you're writing an action/adventure film like Rambo or a superhero film like Iron Man)Juno, as a drama/comedy, has no plausibility. Audiences who saw this film were simply looking to be entertained and they did not approach this film with the background of a screenwriter. But great dialogue does NOT MAKETH a GREAT MOVIE. Great dialogue ELEVATES a good story. But I can't say that Juno is even a good story. I'm not sure what is ""good"" about it especially when it treats one of the most polarizing topics in the United States (abortion) with such triteness!I've read interviews with Diablo Cody about how she came to write Juno, and what I found most interesting is that she focused more on the dialogue of her story than anything else. And in many ways, she had to! The story in and of itself, as it is presented on screen, is boring. It does not stimulate and it does not provoke. If the dialogue had fallen flat in this picture, Juno would not even have ranked a blip at the Toronto film festival. Now Juno COULD have been more stimulating a picture, if the issue of abortion had been delved upon much more in depth. But then that would have changed the point of the story. By avoiding the issue of abortion, Diablo make this film much more palatable to the movie going audience. She's no dummy!In conclusion, if you are looking for light entertainment, then go see Juno. The dialogue is what makes this film. Yes, Ellen Page does a masterful job of capturing the character of Juno. I actually hope to see her star some day in better films than Juno as she is obviously a capable actress. Time will tell. What I took from this picture was that audiences like films where everything is resolved by the end of the story and the lead character rides off into the sunset. Audiences enjoy seeing films that don't provoke and merely entertain. Audiences want to forget about ""reality"" and see a film that describes another world far removed from the one they are living in.",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",3.0,0

"Unfortunately, television history tends to overlook and oversimplify events. That is what happens with ""The Roman Empire in the First Century."" The writers have managed to make the dramatic events that shaped Rome appear boring, and are treated with little care for facts in many cases. The emperor Nero is hardly explored as to his personality (the greatest detail given over to the murder of his mother)and Claudius is skirted over as if his only purpose was to place Nero in the succession.Granted, it is difficult to put 100 years of such important events into a four hour program but I find it difficult to understand how such a pivotal year as 69 CE is reduced to a footnote with the empire going with little pause from Nero to Vespasian! It is as if Galba, Otho and Vitellius had never existed let alone been emperors of the Roman Empire. The program focuses on the views of Seneca and Pliny the Younger but does not provide much about their motives for cooperating with tyrants or much on their backgrounds. We are informed that Seneca was exiled at the whim of a tyrant (Claudius) but not told that he was probably involved in a conspiracy with Claudius's niece, Julia. Similarly, Pliny prospered under Domitian but after he was assassinated he turned to blackening his character.The experts who are interviewed for the program are certainly qualified to discuss their subjects but I have always wondered why someone like Barbara Levick, who as the author of biographies of Claudius and Vespasian, (or especially Michael Grant)would be invaluable. Sygorney Weaver, a great actress, reads the script at a monotonous pace.In short, if you want to understand The Roman Empire in the first century, buy books at Amazon and not this video.",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2.0,-1

"I remember watching this movie as a kid, but couldn't really recall much about it other than that I enjoyed it.  I saw it on Amazon recently and was eager to pick up a copy and see what I think to it now.I found it to be a fun movie.  It has a definite ""80's"" feel to it that I liked.  It made me smile in a few places, but I didn't find it a hilarious ""laugh-a-minute"" type movie experience.  The movie had a very ""cartoon"" type feel to it - with some scenarios being quite ridiculous (but still fun!)It's not the greatest film I've ever seen.  The dialogue was weak and awkward in places and sometimes it was just a bit too strange for my tastes.  But it's a fun movie anyways.

The second time it was not too bad.  Now, having watched it for a third time, it's actually pretty good.  I agree with many that Daisy, Daisy Adair was horribly mis-cast and should have either been given her lights, like Rube or they should have waited for the original actress to be available.  I was very pleased that they got most of the original cast back, it made the movie seeing them all again.I did not like the new boss, I am glad they got rid of him by the end.  I was sorry to see Der Waffle Haus go, maybe it was a chain and they could find another one, I missed Kiffany.  It's too bad there is no fan fiction video as I certain would love to see more Dead Like Me.The wife and I enjoyed seeing the clocks and the references to time all though the episode.  It was good to see the sisters interacting.  I love that classic red Mustang George drives!Everytime we watch Dead Like Me the TV series or the movie, we see more that we missed before.  It's a great series and a good movie.

I grew up in early 1960's but I guess the 3 channels we received didn't broadcast this series. What a wonderful group of stories. Like most TV shows from that time period these are very grainy at times but I expected that for the technology at that time.

The corn field is inside the city, for crying out loud.  How scary can that be?At least the fourth movie was a bit of an improvement.  I would strongly recommend looking into the first two Children of the Corn movies before spending money on this low budget film.

"I wasn't crazy about the cinematography at all. The camera moved around a lot. It was like filming a home movie. At times it was really hard to watch and follow. Granted at those times, the actor was self-filming in first person, but for most of the movie bouncing around, it was kind of much.With that said, the story was just okay for me. It got really creepy fast and I liked that, but with the weird cinematography, I still often felt lost.Ok, picture the movie, The Blair Witch Project. Remember how that was filmed? This is much the same, but for me, worse. I really just couldn't get into it.I still think though it wasn't for me it could be for you.

An absolute classic. Stand out performance by the naval training officer Foley. Very inspirational and emotionally heartfelt movie. Too many people call this movie a romance though. This is not a romance. There are of course romantic elements to it but An Officer and A Gentleman is more about working class American men and women. The movie is essentially about young people trying to follow their hopes and dreams. You've got two young guys trying to be naval officers and two young women who are factory workers trying to meet the men of their dreams in hopes of escaping their dull lives. Without a doubt this is one of the most inspirational and uplifting movies I've ever seen. Sure it's pretty dated and cheesy in certain areas but that's part of it's charm. The thing that's interesting about this film isn't the romantic aspects or even the naval academy training. What's really interesting is how realistic all of the events and relationships are portrayed. The film deals with some heavy subjects and isn't afraid to take some chances with comedy or drama. The scene in the middle of the film is particularly interesting when Foley is basically getting to the root of Zach's problems and playing with his head. This all leads to a fight between the two towards the end of the movie. This is seriously an awesome scene. Absolutely one of my all time favorites.,1456790400,"03 1, 2016",5.0,1

"""On the night of the big high school prom, the dead rise to eat the living, and the only people who can stop them are the losers who couldn't get dates to the dance.""  That's the tagline for Dance Of The Dead, and with a premise with like that, how can it miss??  I was expecting an over-the-top, comedy-tinged horror ride like ""Re-Animator"" or ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"", but Dance Of The Dead came off (to me) as more of a horror spoof than a horror comedy, and reminded me more of ""Scream"" or ""Cursed"" than of something like Evil Dead 2.  Now, depending on one's individual preferences, that isn't Necessarily a negative, but for me personally it was.  The end of the school year is fast approaching and preparations for the prom are well underway, while at the local cemetary trouble is afoot with the stirrings of the restless undead.  Sounds good so far.  The local undertaker seems both aware of the trouble and the impending uprising, but not much inclined to do anything about it, other than whack the occasional early-rising zombie and go on about his business.  Neither he nor the movie ever really tells us what's going on with the character, and it didn't work as creating a cool, purposefully unexplained mystery; or succeed as being funny. It Might have worked either way (straight or comedic), but it feels like a tacked-on prelude the way it is.  Perhaps they're planning on exploring this aspect further in a sequel.  From then on, it continues a path of hitting some high notes while missing others.  There's no one plot point or big hit-or-miss to point to as to why it didn't live up to its potential, it's just that the overall tone feels more like a parody of zombie movies than an actual zombie movie.  It's like I imagine ""Shaun Of The Dead"" to be from the trailers (never actually saw that movie) - the living dead come off as buffoons who don't exactly pose an apocalyptic threat: you can tackle one and rip its arm off by giving it a good yank.  And lots of time is spent trying to set up humorous situations.  I'll admit that some of them worked, but for every amusing scene or joke they were two more that fell flat.  The zombie rampage never reached the kind of over-the-top zest that a movie like this called for, and another flaw is that a horror comedy placing itself on prom night should by definition be sexy, at least some of the time.  Dance Of The Dead didn't really even try on that route though, although the actresses are certainly attractive.  Alright, on to the good points.  It had a good basis, and competent acting on some characters who could have really helped the show along, they kind of grew on you as the movie went on.  In fact, in the last half hour or so, Dance Of The Dead even started to win me over a bit as the spoofish feel started to wear off in favor of an emerging genuine humor or charm.  If this had kicked in sooner and had progressed more I probably would have given the movie a higher rating.  There was one scene toward the end, involving two characters both in the early stages of zombie infection, that was both tender and horrifying, and hinted at what this movie might have been if it had taken itself more seriously.  Just a Bit more seriously, mind you - I'm not saying it should have had a ""Night Of The Living Dead""-type totally serious approach, but it didn't merely go for fun and laughs, it seemed to be just plain goofing around a lot of the time.  And that was unfortunate, because there were tonnes of potential here.  Obviously a lot of people (judging by the high average ratings here and on other sites) thought it was a great movie, but personally I really wish it had been less of a parody.  The bottom line is that if you've enjoyed movies like Scream, Shaun Of The Dead, or Jason X (the only Friday The 13th I couldn't get into, kind of a deliberate self-parody itself) you'll probably also enjoy this one.  If you're not into the spoof-types you're less likely to really get into Dance Of The Dead.  On a technical level it's not at all bad, and to be fair, if I'm going to classify it as a horror parody I have to admit that it's among the best of its breed - it manages on several occasions to be amusing, it's never dull, and its particular kind of parody seems a bit better-natured and less scornful, less blatantly absurd, than some of its peers.  So you could do worse than this one, but it didn't nearly meet my (admittedly pretty high) hopes.  Leaves itself wide open for a sequel, and perhaps that'll more fully live up to the promise in this great idea.",1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2.0,-1

Although one can try to forgive the producers matching up two actors in a romantic comedy when one is 54 (Grant) and the other is 24 (Loren) it's just too much to let slide.

"That's something that bugs me - agreeing with everyone else on here. Take something else I've reviewed, some reality TV dreck, I dunno - usually it's just full of reviews like ""Shayne really steals the show with his cover of Dancin' In The Moonlight, and now I luv this show 4eva and I luv Shayne 4eva"" by some mindless pondlife, then along comes The Curmudgeon and gives The Truth.But here, it's both too easy and too hard. See, it's too easy because EVERYONE is slating this movie - every review is 2 stars or less and everyone is saying the same thing - that the movie sucks. And here's where it's too hard - it's too hard NOT to join in, because the movie is THAT bad.A lot of people like to bunch together bad comic book movies as a discussion piece, and Catwoman will join that infamous list as its most recent calamity (but by no means the worst - step forward Supergirl for that honour). Now, box office flops usually get put alongside the bad ones, but just because they didn't do well financially doesn't make them bad (the Phantom and the new Punisher are two common names thrown in. Phantom was an excellent homage to the classic 30's serials, giving an old-fashioned sense of adventure with a likable hero, albeit in a silly costume and Punisher was just all kinds of awesome).Catwoman, however, deserved to tank the way it did. And the likes of Phantom and Punisher didn't have either the cash or the media exposure this film did. As much as she attempts to save face nowadays (her post-modern, tongue in cheek ""victory speech"" as she won worst actress), Halle Berry promoted the HELL out of this film, and she really did think she was, ahem, the cats whiskers, trying to convince us all on numerous talk shows that this Catwoman was the sexiest thing on the screen.And, lord, is it quite the opposite. Berry's catwoman is as alluring and sexy as some urine-soaked tramp sitting next to you on a bus. She ranges from acting really badly to just being plain embarrassing. When she's normal Patience Phillips (oh dear) she's bearable, if not exactly Oscar worthy (as she once was), but when she becomes Catwoman you really will be watching through your fingers as she says Miaow, ""purrrrrrrfect"", gets scared of the rain and hisses at dogs. Yes, all of this happens.Add to the mix stereotypical sassy girlfriend, token gay guy making ""funny faces"" at her boyfriend, a ridiculous Sharon Stone and some beyond dodgy CGI and you have one movie that no amount of ""taking it on the chin"" good naturedness will save.Nice Catwoman documentary on the DVD, mind.

"Again, they make a film with a decent story a good actor (the others I will get to) and finally Vampires, which, I love. and yet they manage to ruin this film So Badly I couldn't even recommend it to my B movie fanatics. truly another tragedy. Armande Assante could have shined in this role but alas due to a terrible budget and a very bad actress (Lucila Sol as Armande's Vampire girl) Has got to be quite simply put, the worst actress I have ever had the extream displeasure to have been tortured with. the story starts off with a young couple going to a very strange hotel where a Satanic cult of Vampires awaits unsuspecting people but wait, the main character is related to St. George and is supposed to slay the ""dragon"" in this case vampires. ooof. this like i said Had the chance to shine but was so tarnished by bad acting, low budget and a story that could have been good (**spoiler**) the demon at the end looked decent however the suit looks very much like the one worn in the 1972 Film Gargoyles. and that by far was a better film.do not buy this.

As far as the 8 films to die for series goes this one rates among the better ones.  It has it's story and sticks to it. The acting is actually very good and the story kept me interested.  The movie does get a wee bit on the cheesy side towards the end and I fee like there was some missed potential with this concept but it was definitely well worth the watch. My biggest complaint is how stupid the monsters look.  I really feel like they could have done a whole bunch more with them if they had taken to time. But if my only complaint is that the monsters are stupid then I think the movie did a pretty good job especially for a low budget film.

"I found myself wondering if this film were based on a video game.  Lame acting--main character seems to be on drugs.  More action than character development.  Unrealistic reactions from some characters.  For this type of movie, didn't like the flashback style of the beginning.  No need to see the first few minutes again.However, most of the movie was better than I expected.  This movie received terrible reviews and was only in theaters where I live for a very short time.  Didn't expect much, so wasn't disappointed.Except with the ending.  Very abrupt and left me going HUH??  Pretty obvious what would eventually happen, but interesting that the creators avoided explicit violence at the very end, unlike throughout the earlier film.  I think they were hoping the film would be a hit so they could justify a sequel that would pick up at this point.  Probably not, unless it goes straight to video.",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2.0,-1

"The lone survivor of the Erotic Witch Project creates havoc while undergoing psychiatric treatment at a top-secret medical facility. THIS IS A COMEDY! Director John Bacchus has broken the boredom of sex-laden direct-to-video erotic filmmaking, churning out movie after movie at breakneck pace (hard for even me to keep up with) with an incredible end product each time. EROTIC WITCH 2 is his best yet, being the funniest and sexiest of anything he's done so far. All the acting is great, the direction & editing are way better than usual for this format...and then there's Darian Caine. While she's the only returning actress from the first movie, she steals the show every time with her uninhibited & energetic performance. She's just so damn funny, and not afraid to be non-sexual if the moment is right. Truly a great talent, I would probably watch anything as long as she was in it. Darian brings even more fire to an already hot picture. Way more NUDITY & SEX than in the original. There are at least 5 or 6 girl/girl sex scenes with full nudity, all softcore (of course). The 3-way at the end of the first one is topped here by a 5-way featuring all the female actresses that appear in the film. Unlike the first movie, the plot of this one doesn't even try to imitate the plot of BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS. I guess no one really saw it so they didn't figure anyone would care. Plus, they were limited to shooting on video. Ah, what am I complaining about? This movie rules! And like the other Bacchus DVDs, this one features a 30-minute ""making of"" featurette and a ton of trailers for other Seduction Cinema releases. Can you beat that? Put this one on at your next party and see who becomes an instant fan! EROTIC WITCH 1, MISTRESS FRANKENSTEIN, and EROTIC SURVIVOR are also highly recommended.",991872000,"06 7, 2001",5.0,1

"The first two Mummy flicks were both obvious labors of love by Stephen Sommers, their writer/director. They were amazing showcases for CGI effects, but beyond that they had engaging stories full of pulp action, lots of comedy that did not descend into camp, and wonderful characters performed by perfectly cast actors. Brendan Fraser, as American soldier-of-fortune Rick O'Connell, was a perfect pulp hero, brash and cocky and capable. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn ""Evy"" O'Connell (n Carnahan) was the brilliant and (extraordinarily) sexy librarian who could hold her own in a scrap. Together they had incredible chemistry, crack comic timing, and the charm and natural repartee of a classic  Hollywood couple (like Gable and Lombard, or Powell and Loy).Throw in John Hannah as Evy's sleazy but lovable brother, Arnold Vosloo as great villain Imhotep (whose ultimate fate, at the end of the second film, possesses pathos and tragedy), and a host of great supporting roles, and you have some flicks with great characters on the screen at all times. Even the kid who plays the O'Connell's son, Alex, in the second film is brash and bratty without being annoying, a rare thing in a character like his.The O'Connell's adventures continued in a short-lived cartoon that was fairly good, and I remember it fondly as one of the few sources of pulp goodness I could share with my then five-year-old son.He and I watched The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor last night. When I say it's incredible, well, you'd darn well better believe that I am lying. Flat out full of it. On a George W. Bush scale. Because it's terrible.Here's what's good about it:  * The idea to do a third Mummy film.  * The idea to use China as the setting, to do something different with the mummy idea this time around.  * The idea to cast Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (always a great idea to cast either, an exceptional idea to have `em both).  * Some cool creatures, like a really nicely done dragon, but especially the yeti. Because the yeti are the one point of absolute true awesome in the whole flick.  * The final battle is okay.You may notice that three of the things that are good about the movie start with ""The idea to..."" But those things ended without bringing the ideas to enjoyable fruition. The way it turned out, it was actually a bad idea to do a third Mummy film, the idea to use China was fine but the resulting story wasn't that interesting (though a good script doctor could have done great things with it), and they got Li and Yeoh in the film, and gave them both very little to do that was at all interesting.This movie isn't a labor of love for Stephen Sommers, who this time just produced. It possesses none of the warmth or wit or charm of the previous films. The action is dull. The characters are uninteresting, and the main characters are written inconsistently with their earlier portrayals.This is a bad movie. But beyond that, it's a bad movie with a worst thing about it. No, it's a bad movie with a Worst Thing About It. And that worst thing is Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz (who read the script and smartly refused to do it) as Evy.This Worst Thing About It is two sided. First, it's bad because we lose Weisz, who was always magnetic and funny and smart and strong and just smoking hot as this character, and who had wondrous chemistry with Brendan Fraser.Second, it's bad because we wind up with Bello, who is a very talented actress, but plays Evy with all the spunk and sexiness of a wad of mashed potatoes, and who has absolutely no chemistry with Fraser.I can't overstate how badly this miscasting damages the film. The relationship between Rick and Evy is the heart of these movies, and had Weisz returned, this film would be at least twice as watchable just because of the dynamic between her and Fraser. Bello's performance is a sinkhole that draws the attention and drains away even what little vim there is in this movie. Even my son, who normally wouldn't be caught dead saying he cared about which actress plays a girl character, started kvetching almost immediately, and early in the film started cheering on the villains whenever they had Evy in deadly peril. He genuinely liked Rachel Weisz, and her replacement by Bello was so awful it was like a personal offense to him (and to me, and likely to a vast majority of fans of the previous films).This film pretty much murders the franchise. This Mummy stays dead, and it should never have been born.",1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2.0,-1

A lot of no name kids so there was no thought of who they should be like already.  Since I had no idea what the movie was supposed to be about I had the advantage of being able to enjoy it and not compare it to the book.  I thought it did a good job of showing the good and evil in people we want to trust.  After reading the book, I thought they both stood on their own.  They did what they always do. They cut things from the book, and focus more on certain other things.  It worked well enough.  The movie is worth watching.  Some will like it.  Some won't.",1409011200,"08 26, 2014",4.0,1

Great fun and intrigue. Don't assume anything during this movie. You will learn bits and pieces about the characters and what leads up to the main plot throughout the movie. For best plot tracking and entertainment watch both part 1 and 2 at the same time. The actors play their unique roles wonderfully.

"Why are you people giving this movie such good reviews?!?!? Seriously, ""Scream 4"" SUCKS!I am a huge fan of the original ""Scream"" trilogy. Admittedly, the first movie was much better than the second and third, but ""Scream 4"" makes 2 and 3 seem Oscar worthy. You would think that Wes Craven had enough time to come up with  a good script, but he so DID NOT. Yes, it is fun to see all these characters again, and it's fun to see a couple of currently popular actresses that I hate get butchered on screen, but the enjoyment ends there. This movie is all over the place. I don't think enough time is devoted to the original three characters. I also think the overall plot is SUPER lame. All of the new characters are incredibly annoying, and there just isn't anything redeemable about this movie AT ALL. What a disappointment.

"Listen, I wasn't expecting this movie to be a masterpiece. I hate to say it, but Scarlett Johansson isn't exactly the best actress out there, and I guess their way of dealing with that was to have her tilt her head and talk in a monotonous, robotic fashion, the entire movie. I'm also getting the sense that Morgan Freeman is now signing on to projects without reading them, first, just so he can pass the time. Too bad. I put the movie on as something to run in the background to mildly amuse me, and it barely accomplished that. Honestly, it felt like more of a task, by the time it was finished.It was artistically interesting from a visual perspective. I'll give them that much, hence the 2nd star. The ""acting"" was absolutely terrible (what did I expect?). I suspected the movie would be sub-par, right off the bat, with the strange way it started off, and the flashing images of gazelles scared of being eaten (We get it, you were trying to clue us in on the fact that Lucy was like the prey. No National Geographic footage required.). The ""story"" lacked any depth. It could have at least made up for that a little, with some action/excitement, but there were no real action scenes, to speak of. At least not the type a viewer usually wants to see, with a well-balanced fight and some real grittiness and suspense. It was really just about a trashy woman who turns into an invincible woman, who then easily destroys anyone who tries to stop her from getting from point A to B, with the swipe of a hand and some telekinesis. The story was silly and not at all interesting, or well thought out. There was not a single surprise or twist or ""A-HA"" moment.",1424217600,"02 18, 2015",2.0,-1

"This review contains spoilers.This indie movie pushed Hilary Swank into the limelight.  Thankfully she proves that she is a lot better than 'The Karate Kid 2' and 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (the movie) might suggest.  Her fantastic performance is surprisingly unsentimental and in this immensely moving.  There are few actresses that could take on this role but Swank is perfect, and a lot better than Annette Bening was in 'American Beauty' (finally, it's nice to see the award going to the right person).  The fact that this was based on a real-life case makes it all the more poignant.The basic plot is of a young lady called Teena Brandon struggling with her sexuality, and so dresses as a male under the pseudonym Brandon.  Her subsequent love affair with Lara (Chloe Sevigny) and tense meetings with her family make for difficult viewing.Admitedly, at the start the movie is intriguing but a little slow-moving.  However, after the poignant affair between Brandon and his/her love Lara, it becomes entirely mesmerising.  All the way through though, you're nervous because of Brandon's inevitable discovery.  The rape scenes at the end are thankfully completely non-exploitive whilst certainly not lacking in horrifying drama.  The fact that this betrayal is carried out by Brandon's supposed friends makes it all the more terrible.This isn't a movie that you'll want to watch again but it will definitely affect you greatly.",1006560000,"11 24, 2001",4.0,1

I prefer the Director's Cut and highly recommend it to first-time viewers because I think it is superior to the many other versions of this movie that exist, but that said, all versions are great. I love everything about this movie.Here are some reasons why this is my favorite movie ever:--The soundtrack and visuals are beautiful and together create a breathtaking atmosphere.--The acting is great, and so are the characters.--The plot and story are fascinating.--This is a movie that makes one think. Brings up many philosophical questions, such as ""What does it mean to be human?""--There are so many powerful, emotional moments in this movie that I find really meaningful.--This movie never gets old, I can watch it over and over again and never get sick of it.",1429142400,"04 16, 2015",5.0,1

You need to suspend disbelief a little bit, but that is true of most movies, whether they deal with supernatural subjects or not.But the best thing about this movie is the creepy factor.  It's also extremely scary, and I love to be scared, as do most people who enjoy horror movies.  The director and actors do I really good job of drawing you into the action, and making the audience feel as though they are right there in the middle of it.

"As I first saw previews for FIRST DAUGHTER, I thought it looked like a really cute movie. I never saw it in theatres, but I rented it today, and I can't say I was too impressed by it.FIRST DAUGHTER is about the president's daughter (played by Katie Holmes, who I find really likeable). She feels like she's being treated like a little kid, even though she's heading off to college, and she just wants some more freedom. Of course, she gets watched over all the time, and when she gets to college it isn't any different. Along the way, she makes friends with Mia, her roommate that's always looking for a good time, and James, her RA. Just as Samantha starts to fall for James, she finds out that he has a huge secret.I enjoyed FIRST DAUGHTER, but the storyline was really predictable and somewhat forgettable. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be the next Princess Diaries, and if that's your kind of movie, I'd recommend getting FIRST DAUGHTER.Overall grade - C",1108339200,"02 14, 2005",3.0,0

"I just love these older movies, They really are classics. And sharing them with the younger generation of my family not only brings back memories it creates new one with the grand kids. There are just so many great movies but the classic family ones are my all time favorites with out a doubt. I have shared them with my own kids growing up and now I am sharing them with my grand kids. I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down.

I also believe they truly captured the spirit of the Japanese military and how they threw themselves into the battle.  The series showed very well what the Americans were feeling in battle and out of battle.  The director and actors did a great job in portraying the feelings and emotions of the American military.

"I just finished watching the Japanese premier release of ""Charlie's Angels--Full Throttle"" and have now very mixed feelings about it.  I gave this one 4 stars, but the fact is it is slightly lower than that.  Though not as much as the original movie's fun, it is still fun anyway.  Maybe I expected much actions.  Well, let me explain.Don't think about the story, and that's the rule of the original series in 1970s, and the first picture.  The same thing can be said again.  All I can say is that you will see some conspiracy about two stolen rings, a former Angel Madison (Demi Moore), Dylan's ex-boyfriend who suddenly shows up (not that 'Chad' ... thank Heaven), witness protection program, and many, many costumes.  Anyway, you don't summerize the first one's, let's skip this part.Three Angels -- Cameron Diaz's 'Natalie,' Drew Barrymore's 'Dylan,' and Lucy Liu's ""Alex' are all back.  They are still fun/danger-loving three secret agents, but actions are less compared with the first movie.  Or I should say, if you expect to see the wire actions they showed surprisingly well on the former occasion, you might be disappointed.  The film gives more stress on comic/sexy aspect of the original, and you notice the increased amount of special effects used here.  Actions themselves are done competently, but about the CGIs, not every part is perfect.  Oh, and as to costumes, especially those of Natalie, I might add that her revealing attires are not changing, so ... you know what I mean.Perhaps most interesting part of ""Full Throttle"" is its supporting or guest stars.  Several members from the original film's cast come back again -- Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and  Crispin Glover as The Thin Man -- but Bosley's role is replaced by 'his brother' Bernie Mac, so you won't see Bill's face except briefly on a photo hanging on the wall.  Many guests are added this time, though, among whom you will see Robert Patrick, Robert Forster, Justin Theroux, John Cleese, and one of the real original Angels.  And you see famous twin sisters in a hilarious way.But it is Demi Moore who will astonish you, in a good sense, or a bad sense (you choose it).  First she appears just like the first Bond girl (don't miss the surfing scene).  Then she gets more and more ... campy, perhaps intentionally, I hope.  I almost forgot one important thing.  One big star appears as a cameo who gets killed.  And if you know who he is, and later comes to realize who kills him, this is the biggest in-jokes the film offers.Suppose this film is a comedy, just harmless fun.  Some of you might dislike this one, but the chances are you have already seen the original one, so in that case, especially when you loved its comic side, you won't be disapointed.  But I expected some actions, and I knew that Yuen Cheung-Yan was involved again for the producion (and he is brother of Woo-Ping, famous for his work in ""Matrix"").  Impresssive (but often very ridiculous) bike stunts or skateboarding ride are there, but I find they are not enough.  Instead, you see lots of gags, verbal or physical, gross-out or sexual.  And they included many, many references to other famous films, which are certainly funny.  So, when one of the angels appears as cheerleader, you hear the song ""Mickey"" (yeah, ""Bring it On"")  And when these Angels stake out, welding, yes, you hear Irene Cara song.  Maybe too predictable, but it's just OK.Don't think this sequel is improvement on the first film.  It is like ""Austin Powers""; the first one's sensation and funny is reduced, but the good supporting actors/actresses are still helpful.  More jokes, less actions, but still fun.",1056153600,"06 21, 2003",4.0,1

"I was interested in this movie because I'm a big fan of cryptozoology and unexplained creatures. I'd also heard the book which this film is based on was well-received so I thought I would check it out. The fact that it was based on a true story made it even more exciting.My excitement waned however after the first 30 minutes of sitting through this 2 hour version of an X-Files episode. Aside from a decent bridge collapse scene, I saw absolutely nothing that set it apart, and there was probably better acting on the X-Files. Gere didn't really lend anything to this movie (beside his name) that any other actor couldn't have done. And Debra Messing gave an unconvincing job as a feature actress. At the end of the film, I'm not even sure why she was in it, or what her character's role was.The ""Mothman"" wasn't very scary or very interesting, and i couldn't tell if I was supposed to be more concerned over possible future prophecies or the lead character's mental state.I was left watching a film that was so so, and with a lot of questions that the movie left unexplained. Fortunately, I wasn't interested enough in the film to care.A movie like this should leave you wanting more. I should have finished the film and rushed to the Internet to find out more about the real life sightings and what exactly happened. Not only did I not have this feeling at the end of the movie, but I am now even less interested in the real ""Mothman"" than before I saw it.",1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2.0,-1

"The effects superb, the re-imagining excellent, the script wonderful, the acting...Rachel Weisz was excellent as the witch. She was great with her portrayal, Williams and Kunis? mmmm I'd say bad. Kunis is not a hot actress, she is not a good actress (especially for Action/Fantasy movies). She fits more into comedy (that's what ballooned her into recognition after That 70's show). Williams didn't fit into this movie.Then come Franco, I like Franco. He is a good actor but in this one he wasn't at all. Can't put my finger on it but it wasn't attractive nor captivating his performance.The movie could have been better and in fact, it could have been a whopper of a hit but...not this one.",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2.0,-1

"Men of Honor is a biographical movie about Carl Brashear, who was the first Afro-American Navy diver in history. What could have been an inspiring film about one man's overcoming of some very big obstacles turns out instead to be a standard and predictable military flick. It is entertaining enough, but its subject matter deserved more creative effort.Brashear [Cuba Gooding, Jr., grew up during World War II on a tenant farm in Kentucky. His father's dream was that Carl would turn out to be somebody, that he would leave the farm and never come back. Carl joined the Navy in the early 50s. Our armed forces had been desegregated by President Truman in 1948, but Carl soon finds out that the Navy has paid only lip service to this change. About the only jobs available to blacks are those of cooks or drivers. After persisting for several years, Carl finally gets admitted to the Navy diving school. At first, Billy Sunday [Robert De Niro}, the head instructor, won't let Carl onto the base. Then his fellow students, all of them white, refuse to bunk with him. After that, it only gets worse. Carl must prove himself over and over again. But as I said, Carl is a very persistent fellow who would rather die than disappoint his father.As far as I know, the movie faithfully follows Brashear's career path, but I suspect great liberties have been taken with the characters he met along the way. Billy Sunday is portrayed as a foul-mouth, bigoted redneck, who will do anything he can think of, of as well as anything he is ordered to do, to prevent Carl from succeeding. Then, in typical Hollywood fashion, Sunday turns out to be a good guy underneath it all. I know what the movie is trying to say. People change. Still, Sunday's early behavior goes way beyond macho spirit breaking. It is mean and vindictive, and one wonders how Carl can speak to the man later, much less let him help him.Gooding and De Niro, professionals that they are, do excellent jobs with characters that are basically one-dimensional. Charlize Theron, who is quietly building a formidable reputation as a character actress, is striking as Gwen Sunday, a very interesting character who I wish had been on screen more often. An even more intriguing character is Carl's father, marvelously played by Carl Lumbly, but we see him for less than five minutes. If script writer Scott Marshall Smith had worked harder on making the main characters as interesting, Men of Honor would have been a much better movie.",1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2.0,-1

"Given the great success, both artistic and and financial, of Legally Blonde perhaps it was inevitable there be a sequel. What wasn't inevitable was that it be this bad.To start with, Elle Woods' IQ has dropped about 30 points between films. Maybe 40. Her characterization consists primarily of doing and saying things so godawfully stupid we cringe. In the first movie, though Elle was portrayed as sort of super-Valley Girl, and a bit obsessional on the topics of clothes and hair care products, still there was a first-rate brain under all that curly blonde hair. Where is the smart, self-possessed, articulate Elle from the end of the first movie? I ask, because she's nowhere to be seen in Legally Blonde 2. Reese Witherspoon is a fine actress who should have known enough to flee in terror from this script.Another problem with Legally Blond 2: the plot is built around obvious absurdities. Elle decides she needs to find her dog Bruiser's mother so she can invite Mrs. Bruiser to her upcoming wedding. Jesus wept. Let's pause for a moment to recognize that in the first movie, even though Elle loved her pet as much as many pet owners do, she never descended into blithering idiocy about it. Elle hires a private detective to locate the mother of this homeless stray she found on the street years ago....and the detective does it! No explanation of how, it's just a fait accompli. All I could think was, ""You have GOT to be kidding me."" In the first movie, its great attraction was that it took place basically in the real world, with a logical cause-and-effect system in place. It's just that Elle was the destabilizing factor that pushed things over the edge into comedy. In Legally Blonde 2 there's no logical cause-and-effect; things happen just because the plot requires them.Elle, using the detective's information, tracks Mrs. Bruiser to an animal testing facility. Thereafter we're treated to a dissertation on what a horrible, horrible thing this is. Okay, the morality of animal testing is something we could debate, pro and con. There's a place for that, but it's not in a movie like this. If you want to preach, get a soapbox. We're paying our eight dollars and fifty cents on a Reese Witherspoon Legally Blonde movie to be amused and entertained, not to watch the world's longest PETA commercial.",1127088000,"09 19, 2005",1.0,-1

"I agree with the reviewers who say that this film doesn't really know what it wants to be. I must say that after watching it, I would not place this in the fantasy genre. I mean, it has it's fantastical elements, but when you get down to it, it's more of a friendship film with a great imagination. The two leads do a remarkable job portraying middle school kids who form a type of bond dealing with an imaginary world. Its actually very sweet and sentimental. That aspect of the film really is what makes it worthwhile. I found that when they introduce the fantasy elements, the film lost it's trail of thought. I'm aware this is based off a book, and maybe the book portrays things better. But as a film, it doesn't quite work. Still worth a look. It does have an unexpected ending which caught me off guard. Its a very bittersweet sort of film.",1213747200,"06 18, 2008",3.0,0

"""The Truth About Charlie"" is a remake of the classic ""Charade."" Judging by the other reviews here, fortunately I have not seen the original, and thus I went in unbiased. The whole film was very entertaining, and my friend and I walked out with grins on our faces.Thandie Newton brings substantial talent and charm to bear in her role as Regina, and I feel she has a lot to offer as an actress. Mark Wahlberg did a passable job as the mysterious ""Mr. Peters,"" although he has yet to fully come into his talents. The members of the supporting cast did a very good job as well; Lisa Gay Hamilton was particularly enjoyable in her role as Lola.The plot: Regina returns home from a Caribbean vacation to find her apartment empty and vandalized, her husband murdered, and herself embroiled in quite a mystery. The resulting turmoil approaches the chaotic, as several new people enter Regina's life, each with a conflicting story about the missing six million dollars Regina's husband seems to have hidden. Naturally, everyone wants the money, and is willing to go to extreme lengths to get it.Regina, even in the midst of an ordeal which could quite possibly endanger her life, is remarkably practical in her dealings with these strange people making her life exceedingly difficult. She doesn't tolerate any BS from anyone, and this seems to disarm them to the point of not knowing what to do - and they all come to like her. In fact, through various experiences, they all seem to reach a point of uneasy friendship, despite being in competition with each other, and occasionally having ""conflicts"" with each other.The story and the characters are great; the direction, on the other hand, suffers, I'm sad to say. Most of the scenes are hand-held and too claustrophobic. The wobbly shots pan and spin, resulting in a somewhat nauseating experience, unfortunately. But apart from the uneasy ride, Demme does a great job of showing us the rich colors and street life of Paris, and comes up with some unusual angles and beautiful views. The majority of the film, though, is spent very up-close-and-personal with the actors' faces, with much moving about that detracts from the charm of the plot.This is a very amusing film, though, with wonderful moments of humor (both subtle and almost slap-stick,) and some truly creative scenes - watch for the tango scene, and enjoy. If it weren't for the handheld camerawork, I might even give it 5 stars.",1036627200,"11 7, 2002",4.0,1

"The premise for ""The Telling"" is that a popular sorority, one year after a rejected pledge killed herself, is accepting less popular (read: not blond) pledges. Three prospective pledges must each tell a horror story in order to gain admission to Omega Kappa Kappa. Thus, we are treated to three horror stories, one involving a spooky doll (a premise I don't think is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/entirely/dp/B001B1UO6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">entirely</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B000FFJZO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>), one involving an aging (30!) actress whom the studios no longer want and who is willing to take any role as long as the check clears, and a story of some bored sorority sisters who make a prank call only to overhear what seems to be a murder. There is also the wrap-around story, of course, involving the suicide.Though the acting is generally competent and there is some inventive camerawork (notably in the second of the three stories), most of the film seems flat. One problem is that the stories, as filmed, are too close to the stories as told, and there is little character development and little effort to transcend the idea of the telling. It certainly is possible to have good and frightening stories in the span of 20 minutes or so, but this film fails for the most part, instead relying on stereotypes, clichs, and predictability.If you absolutely have to watch this, I recommend skipping ahead to the second story, which, while not fully developed, is at least the most inventive of the three. The last story, though its plot may sound like an updating of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sorry-Wrong-Number/dp/B000063URD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sorry, Wrong Number</a>, is too derivative of far too many recent films and by no means up to the standards of that Barbara Stanwyck classic.",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2.0,-1

"Nobody in Hollywood would deny that the movie business is War. And as we all know from General Sherman, War is Hell.First-time director Kevin Yagher found that out the hard way. When studio chiefs brought in Joe Chappelle to fill in what they thought were gaps in the movie, Yagher walked off the set, pulled his name from this fourth Hellraiser installment and cursed it to movie development Hell, branding it with the ultimate shame of having been directed by ""Alan Smithee"", the Hollywood calling card of a disaffected director.Frankly, I think Yagher acted prematurely---""Bloodline"" is flawed, one of the weakest of the brooding ""Hellraiser"" franchise---but taken on its own terms, it bumps and grinds quite nicely and sheds plenty of the red sauce along the way.""Bloodline"" is an entertaining little wallow in the ghoulish legendry of the hellish Cenobites, their tormented minions, and the earthly conjurers who hope to bring the Demons into the material world for gain and glory, and end up giving ""body piercing"" a whole new meaning.""Bloodline"" feels like a film created by committee, which is exactly what it turned out to be. It is uneven, jumping from scene to scene in fits and starts; it's evident that Yagher's vision was unfulfilled and his contempt justified.The film begins on a space station, with Science Officer Dr. Paul Merchant (played by French Canadian actor Bruce Ramsay, who does a stellar turn with all of the Le Merchant/Merchant roles) interrupted by a security team while trying to summon the demonic Cenobites using a high-tech version of the infamous Lament Configuration.Interrogated by one of the marines (played by the lovely but underused Christine Harnos), Merchant reveals that he is the last in a bloodline of inventors and scientists, and that his ancestor Phillip Le Merchant was a fabled 18th century French toymaker who first created the hellish Lament Configuration.Here's my advice: while I bought ""Bloodline"" for its gaudy, gory imagery and style, I would rent it and watch the first 40 minutes, if only for the fact that Yagher commits to celluloid some of the most graphic, stylish, erotic and disturbing images ever filmed.The story of the toymaker's design and delivery of the wicked box to a French nobleman, hedonist and sadist (played to the wild-eyed feverish hilt by Mickey Cottrell) is both hellacious and eerily beautiful, shot in natural light, the candles and firelight glittering on a palette of flesh, bone and blood. It is beautiful stuff, and I can see why Yagher resigned in disgust when his vision was commandeered by Chapelle.Oh, and Chilean actress Valentina Vargas is glorious as the demoness Angelique, with or without skin: she can rend my flesh any day of the week.Other than that, ""Bloodline"" is forgettable: we move from Le Merchant to his 20th century architect descendant and a skyscraper crammed with Cenobites, and thence to the haunted space station. While some reviewers have complained that the gory sequence in which two hapless twin security guards are transformed is both gratuitous and brings the movie to a halt, I enjoyed it: it's a wickedly bloody, gory piece in prime Hellraiser style. Finally, Douglas Bradley is in fine form as Pinhead---but then again, when isn't he?For the hardcore Hellraiser fan, buy this DVD---if you don't have it in your collection already. For the casual gorehound, a rental might suffice, if only to savor the supple, gorgeous, haunting 18th century prologue. For filmmakers, it's a prime example of how not to go about making a horror movie.JSG",1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2.0,-1

"I love most of Criterion's releases and rate their release of ""Children of Paradise"" as the best thus far. That said, this is one film in their collection that I find hugely overrated and pretentious. I am usually a fan of Antonioni but he lost me here. I remember the first time I saw it, I couldn't finish it. When I saw it again yesterday on the Criterion DVD, the best thing I could say about it was 'Well, at least the transfers good'.It is fatiguing that any old black and white movie released by Criterion is proclaimed a masterpiece by cinephiles simply because its released by Criterion. I do not get it. Any way you cut it, this is one lazy shot after another in this movie, as if the director knew that there was no plot so he decided to amuse himself with l-o-n-g shots of the harbor, the islands, and even lazier shots of the lead actress walking up and down hallways, taking a stroll down a road, ambling through bushes. Should be seen to be believed. I am all for this sort of languid pacing (it worked on ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", if you remember), but here it gives you the impression that you're wasting your time.Investing in artistic works from the past is a tricky thing. If you criticize anything by Carne, Fellini, Melville, you are considered lowbrow and uneducated. However, it is hugely possible that many of these directors did churn out substandard films, and this movie is a clear example. The 'climax', if you could call it that, was the icing on a very rotten cake. I did not buy these characters for one minute, did not empathize or feel their pain, and through it all I felt that the lead actress was on some serious medication. There is no other way to describe her loopy, inane performance where she whines and cringes her way through almost three hours of nothingness. If this sort of thing is your bag, I'm glad for you. It wasn't mine.I would recommend ""Nights of Cabiria"" and ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" over this convoluted mess if you ARE looking to buy a new Criterion DVD.Two Stars. A very disappointing movie.",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2.0,-1

But I do have to be honest about a few things in this movie,I wasn't completely in shock of what was happening throughout the movie because around the time I had purchased this movie I was maybe 16 or 17 and I knew girls who were exactly like that and a few of them were friends of mine so I kind of knew what was going to happen next throughout the movie. It was a good movie and I have watched it a few more times since then. It is a bit raw and crazy at times because I was just never like that as a teen(at least not that far gone)so when the movie ended I was like WOW!!That was crazy. Good movie I still watch it till this day(5 years later).Buy This!!!",1256342400,"10 24, 2009",3.0,0

"Ok so I feel that people give this movie a high rating because they are religious. So am I, but it felt like a kind a one sided story, black and white sort of morality. I just find that life is not this simple if it is I sure am not living it lol. Really cheesy and the deep back ground voice kind of turned me off. The movies conclusion says we should fear god and that he is judging all that we do. Well I don't fear god I love him, he is a friend, a voice that is always there telling you the right way to do things. So all in all think this movie has bad messages in certain regards.

"I adore Jane Austen and although her own personal story isn't as interesting as her books it still could have been enjoyable to watch and told better and then in this film.The first half of the movie is ""barely tolerable"". It makes you either want to turn off the TV or fall asleep. The second half picks up enough to at least be able to finish the movie, and the end is somewhat tear jerking. James McAvoy was the only thing I liked about it. He is definitely shines here.The reason I give it a one star:1. The director did a horrible job. It didn't feel professionally done, but more like a collage students first try in directing.2. The acting. Ann Hathaway is beautiful but not a great actress. I was really disappointed by her performance and everyone else's except for McAvoy.3. The music. It was uninspiring and barely noticeable.4. The costumes. They seemed to be made out of polyester and didn't always fit the period. They looked like they were from a costume shop.5. The dialog sucked. It was uninteresting and didn't seem to be from the period. Nothing like the dialog used by Austen in her books.6. The cinematography. They had the beautiful English countryside to work with and it looks like it was filmed in the back yard of a retirement home.The move wasn't at all charming like Austin's novels although that may not have been what they were going for. It didn't capture any cretin style. Not really a romance or a drama film. It was at times crude and vulgar which didn't seem to fit either. Like her parents ""getting it on"", I didn't need to see that! I would have rather seen a well done documentary of her life. Maybe they will remake it some day and hopefully next time due the story justice.",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",1.0,-1

"There is much to be said about this film.  For one thing, it is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best film of the 1990's.  Nearly every frame is loaded with huge amounts of information.  And regardless of what you have heard, with the exception of a few minor changes, it IS accurate  information.  As  director Oliver Stone had said in reponse to the critics  of JFK, a filmmaker must be allowed a certain amount of creative license.  After all, were the best biographical films before and since acclaimed for  their factual truth actually perfect models of accuracy?  Not likely.  So  why the urge to single this one out?  I believe it was because of the  controversial nature of the subject and all of the negativity the Warren  Report has received.  It was, in short, an attempt to discredit all  involved (much like the Warren Commission attempted to do with many of it's  witnesses) including the instigator of the only trial in the assasination  of the 35th president of the United States.  For all the mistakes made  during said trial, Jim Garrison alone stood up to the people and  organizations that tried to keep the truth about that fateful day in 1963  from surfacing.  He and he alone is the most responsible for bringing the  other theories out in the open.  Yes, there had been many books written  that criticized the slipshod way the Warren Commission  ""investigated"", but it was the trial of Clay Shaw in the late  60's that brought many of the speculative theories to the main stream  public for the first time.  Despite Garrison's sometimes questionable  methods, no one can deny the man his motive: to bring forth the truth in  what might very well be the crime of the century.Stone is relentless in  HIS quest for the truth, and it's this marriage of director and story that  make the film so remarkable.  In scene after scene  he reinstates  Garrison's vulnerability with the public.But this did not stop Garrison. Nor over twenty years later in  1991 did it even put a dent in the opinions of Oliver Stone.  The director  uses his connection and knowledge of the 60's that was so apparent in many  of his other films-PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and THE DOORS,  particularly-to attempt to tell the absolutely mesmerizing story of the  D.A. of New Orleans' search for the facts.  He holds the viewer with a  series of superbly edited but very quick sequences that really give a DVD  player a workout.  Thank goodness for slow motion.The script wisely and  fittingly tells this story through the eyes of Garrison himself.  You  really feel the persecution he feels as he becomes more and more obsessed  with his search.  When his wife (well played by Sissy Spacek) finally  confronts Garrison with his obsession, your heart is in your throat.  It's  obvious that even with the people he had working for him, the D.A. is  basically a man alone.  In the final monologue, based on Garrison's final  address to the jury, you certainly hope he succeeds. Fortunately, Stone balances the emotions of a family torn  apart, with some stunning scenes based upon the beliefs and findings of  authors such as Garrison himself, Mark Lane, Jim Marrs and David Lifton.  For the first time we have a big budget, well exposed film that combines  all the theories together.The director's cut only further proves Garrison and Stone's  opinions.  The scene in the washroom could make even the most secure person  paranoid.  And the light banter of the talk show host (played by John  Larroquette) while interviewing the District Attorney is more evidence of  how the public and the press treated the trial.The cast is perfect.  Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and  Donald Sutherland are all familiar faces here effectively placed in roles  that range from mere guest appearances to full fledged important supporting  roles.  The lesser known actors and actresses also excel, especially Jay O  Sanders, Laurie Metcalf and Michael Rooker as Garrison's assistants.  Gary  Oldman as the doomed Lee Harvey Oswald once again proves his chameleon  abilities as an actor and disappears completely in the role.  Hard to  believe that this is the same actor who was just as convincing as the Count  in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and as Sid Vicious in SID AND NANCY, among  others.But it is Kevin Costner's performance as Jim Garrison that always  pulls the film together.  He is very convincing.  It's true that he doesn't  look a thing like the real Jim Garrison.  Fortunately, Costner wisely opted  to use subtle characteristics of Garrison in creating his interpretation of  the man.  The aforementioned final remarks to the jury are not only  believable for what is being said but also for Costner's convincing and  heartfelt delivery.Technically, the film couldn't be better.  The  recreation of the assasination itself, is absolutely perfect, right down to  the little girl that waved as she ran along the side of the President's  limousine just before the shots were fired.  The cinematography works well  with the Oscar winning editing, to hold the audience in the palm of it's  hand.  The atmosphere of New Orleans is beautifully felt.  John Williams  music score is another example of how the composer captures the very mood  of every film he scores.  The beautiful trumpet fanfare he composed for JFK  easily matches  anything from JAWS, STAR WARS, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE,  E.T.-THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, SCHINDLER'S  LIST or the Indiana Jones movies.After many viewings of this film,  I can honestly say that if I would choose to sit and watch it again today,  I would still catch something I hadn't caught before.  What better reason  for owning a copy of JFK (The Director's Cut)?  It must be viewed in it's  widescreen edition.  Watching in a flat or ""full-screen"" format  doesn't do justice to the abundance of information it revels.  And the  dedication to the youth and their search for truth assures that it should  be handed down from generation to generation so that perhaps one day we  will know the whole truth.",957312000,"05 3, 2000",5.0,1

"Once again unforgiveable liberties have been taken with a book to create sensationalistic but ridiculous results. Admitedly I am a fan of Phil Rickman's non-merrily novels (can not for the life of me figure out why he decided to write a series based on his weakest and most unlikable character, but here it is.) so I will state that if network television is going to butcher his novels at least they aren't messing with his best work.Midwinter of the spirit was not the greatest of literary or even paranormal work but it was tremendously better than this hot mess of an adaptation. The entire premise of the novel was thrown out to literally focus on and grotesquely expand on a subplot from the original story. And if you thought Merrily was a short bus ride in the novels the producers here decided to make it abundantly clear why this woman is one of the worst ever created by instilling a level of hysteria that the original Merrily is too dim-witted to reach in the novels. I honestly can not believe the actress agreed to this job. She is does well in other projects so she can't be hurting for work. And Phil Rickman is a fool if he isn't doing everything he can to prevent this kind of butchery from happening to the rest of his books in the future.",1478217600,"11 4, 2016",1.0,-1

"Before I watched ""JFK"" I had no idea. We were not taught this in school. This is a bit of history everyone should learn. The movie starts with the killing of JFK and finishes in a great court room Drama that leaves you thinking. I love movies that do that. This is only a three hour and 10 minute movie but as you watch it/it doesn't seem that long because you are so riveted to the movie. Kevin Costner, is only one actor in a long list of great actors in this movie, to many to name. I recommend this to anyone who likes a little bit of history in their movies. Great Drama, great suspense, it is an excellent thriller. The scene showing the actual head shot is, however, not fit for younger audiences. Five stars all the way!!!!",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",5.0,1

"This is a really, really terrible version of Bronte's classic book. It is absolutely sodden in film-making cliches, shot in a completely unimaginative way, poorly adapted, poorly cast, poorly acted, and extremely poorly directed. The adaption makes a mockery of the fantastic language of the book by making it into a really overly dramatic cliche, with all the obvious things and extremes used. The casting is terrible - Fiennes does his best but is far too Shakespearian for Heathcliff, while Binoche, though a good actress, is a terrible choice for Cathy - with her French accent shining through, and her cute, totally un-wild nature. Also, the transition from children to adults in the film is a real jump and is totally unrealistic - they look about 35 when they are meant to be 15. I watched this with 10 other people who had all read the book and we all just laughed all the way through, because it is such a terrible film and so utterly cliched in the delivery of the lines, in the use of special effects, and so forth.

"""Murder by Numbers"" is based on the real life Leopold-Loeb case of the 1920's and the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock movie ""Rope' although it doesn't credit either. The plot involves 2 upper class and intelligent students planning and executing the perfect murder on a random victim for the thrill and the challenge. In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock. She is good as the detective in pursuit of the twisted murderers but she has very little to work with here as far as the script, the cliched characters and the weak plot twists. She's a good actress but not a magician and this would fall into her lesser movies and possibly her least.",1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2.0,-1

"Other reviewers have written concerning the story line so I won't go into that.I saw this movie on TV & don't have a personal copy. Wouldn't waste money on it. In the hands of a good script writer & director this movie could have been very interesting. As it is, most of it is dull, even boring. If Clint Walker is a good actor I don't know because he is given very little opportunity in this poorly written & directed film to develop his character role. As has been indicated in other reviews, the ending is a real shocker. I am amazed there have been no comments concerning the song that is sung over the ending credits. Since it was sung by a chorus I could not understand all the words. I did hear the words, ""Jerusalem"" & ""turning the other cheek"" so it seems fairly obvious there was meant to be some sort of connection here to Jesus Christ. Since I don't have a personal copy I could not replay that portion to listen more carefully. Too bad it was not sung solo - Clint himself could have sung it I suppose.IMHO this film is truly a ""mixed bag.""",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",1.0,-1

This was a series that will definitely keep you engaged and by the end you will want to come back and watch the episodes again (or at least I did).

"I can always count on Clint Eastwood to make a good movie. Mystic River is just the right amount of drama-- obviously it has some disturbing ideas, but not sick and twisted ones you would see in horror movies (IMO). I mean the movie shows how characters cope with the trauma and troubles that they are faced with. I saw this movie when it came out and again just recently. It is one of my must own movies because it has such a great mysterious plot which kept me guessing. All of the actors including Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon gave great performances. The music suits the movie well. The only thing I found annoying was when Dave (Tim Robbins) kept talking about the forest and the wolf...Alot of people seem to complain about the ending. I think it was sufficient and well made. The idea is to make do with what has happened since you can't take back what has been said or done. etc..This movie gives you something to think about and has a satisfying plot, 5 stars .",1288224000,"10 28, 2010",5.0,1

"Rawhide is a 1951 westernTyrone Power (1914-58) was 20th Century Foxs challenge to MGMs Errol Flynn. He was doing bit parts when director Henry King cast him inLloyds of London (1936) which launched his career. From 1936 to 42 he cranked out a few films every year, some of them notable  Suez (1938), Jesse James (1939), The Mark of Zorro (1940), Blood and Sand (1941). He was never nominated for an Oscar, although his performance in Witness for the Prosecution (1957) certainly deserved one. Power once said  The secret of charm is bulls*** and his film roles were filmed with charm, but not so much here. Power, like Flynn, just didn't look good with a six gun strapped to his waist.Beautiful Susan Hayward (1917-75) plays a head strong woman, a role she did well and often. She was nominated for an Oscar 5 times winning in 1959 for I Want to Live although personally I preferred Ill Cry Tomorrow (1956) and With a Song in my Heart (1953). There is no chemistry between Haywood and Power, but when you've got Hayward, who needs the chemistry?Hugh Marlowe (1911-82) plays the bad guy, a role he rarely played in dozens of films like Twelve OClock High (1949), All About Eve (1950), or my favorite The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Marlow is not convincing, and its good that he stayed with playing more noble characters.Crazy eyed Jack Elam (1920-2003) plays a killer. Elam is best known for his villainous roles in westerns like Vera Cruz (1954), Wichita (1955), The Man From Laramie (1955), and Gunfight at OK Corral (1957). I enjoyed him best as Alamosa Bill in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Later in life he turned to comedy and gave many memorable performances in films like The Apple Dumpling Gang (1979) and Cannonball Run (1981) and on TV. He described his career this way -""Who's Jack Elam? Get me Jack Elam! Get me a Jack Elam type. Get me a young Jack Elam. Who's Jack Elam?"" In this film you see Jack before he lost his eye. Hes just as crazy!The film was directed by Henry Hathaway (1898-1985), a director who specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""Shootout"" (1971), ""5 Card Stud"" (1968), yet curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), and his best known films are non-Westerns (e.g., ""Of Human Bondage"", ""Call Northside 777"", ""The Desert Fox""). He once said ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it."" This is one of Hathaways weaker efforts. My favorite Hathaway western is The Sons of Katie Elder (1965).1951 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were Quo Vadis, Alice in Wonderland, Show Boat, A Streetcar Named Desire, and David and Bathsheba. Oscars went to The Quiet Man (Director), High Noon (Actor), Come Back Little Sheba (Actress), The Greatest Show on Earth (Picture), and Viva Zapata (Supporting Actor).  Other notable releases that year included The African Queen,  The Day the Earth Stood Still, Murder Inc, and A Place in the Sun.Given how many great westerns there are from this time period, don't waste your time with this one.",1465603200,"06 11, 2016",2.0,-1

"I confess to not reading the two thousand plus reviews on this movie. I'm just going to add my two cents worth. I liked the movie. I respect Cruise as an actor, he's pulled off a lot of tough guy roles convincingly.  Yep, this one had its share of plot holes, but no more than the typical action movie. So, based on liking the movie, I bought the first three books in the series. Honestly, I liked the movie better.  Reacher's character in the books is, in my opinion, much less credible than Cruise is in the movie. I hope they make more movies of the Reacher series , and keep Cruise  in the lead role.",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",4.0,1

I was worried about bringing in new actors but they carried it off so well I can't imagine them not being in the next Star Trek movie.  The special effects were perfect.  I thought I was on a ship in space.  There wasn't anything to distract from the story. The new crew are just great but I think the best new actor played Scotty.  Buy this movie.

"I am stumbled as to where to start with this movie.  So many bad things to say, so little time.What I liked:Donnie Yen:  His talent and skill in martial arts really does make it an art.  But his role in this is marginal and his acting is sub-par.What I didn't like:Donnie Yen:  I didn't see him until well into the movie, although he is front & center in the cover.  His acting was not believable after he ""revives"" from near death to glorious hero.THE STORY:  There were too many plots, people, sub plots and minutia to go though.  You need a shovel and you'd reach China before ever understanding what it is they are trying to say.  The movie went on for forever.  The end shows them setting up for a sequel.  No thanks!UNNECESSARY & LENGTHY SCENES:  It seems that the Chinese actors here and the director have fallen victim to an identity crisis.  The movie tries to be traditional Chinese while incorporating Western values to appeal to a broader audience.  Unnecessary sex scenes, bipolar female actresses and too many plots made this movie tedious.THE ACTORS:  Bad actors all around although few good ones you will recognize.  But in the end they didn't develop characters you really cared about.  When you figured out who the bad guy is you either don't care or you will say ""who was that again?""SUMMARY:  We both found ourselves looking at the clock, wondering if the story was every going to ""get there"" and then hoping it was there even though nothing made any sense.  The story stunk.  The fight scenes were over-glorified gore, no finesse, not what we expect from Chinese martial arts movies.  More like a Hollywood B movie.  The innuendoes in the sex scene screamed that they wanted to be part of Hollywood.  The costumes were just ho-hum.

Great balanced horror.I love it when some actors who are past their peak selling years and are mostly retired come back to boost a small but very good film and create a lasting legacy and give local actors a start.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing this.  William Shatner is doing this for his native Canada.  His comic relief sequences and note of pathos at the end round out this film.,1514678400,"12 31, 2017",5.0,1
"This review refers to the 1998 DVD edition, the only edition available as of this writing. ""Chaplin"" is a well-crafted, well-acted biography of the famous silent-screen actor/comedian. The transfer of this 1993 film to DVD is adequate. The format is letter-boxed widescreen (not anamorphic--there are black bars on all sides of the image on a large-screen TV. The side bars are not seen on a smaller screen TV). The picture is fairly sharp, the colors are good, sound quality is fine. The film has an old look about it, but this was probably the intended effect. This is the kind of movie you will watch more than once, so it's worth the purchase price.  Highly recommended!",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",5.0,1
"This is a gem of a movie and I don't know why so many down-rated it???  It is surprisingly good with a fine cast of players and Russell Means is still a great actor!  IN fact, I think he improved with age and ads credibility to the story, which is well written and full of suspense.  Much better than average and I might have paid to see this in the theatre if I had heard about it!",1442361600,"09 16, 2015",4.0,1

Season 3 has the usual wandering around the relationship with Chuck and Sarah, but the final few episodes are better when they finally make a commitment to be together.  However, it gets somewhat irritating when they aren't honest with each other within that relationship.

"Review of The BodyguardHot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017Theres really only legitimate reason to watch The Bodyguard: if you're a Whitney Houston fan. And I mean total, complete, number-one fan. Anyone else in the audience will see from the first scene that Whitney is a terrible excuse for an actress, and the plot is as thin as the romance. And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.Whitneys blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. Its boring, theres no chemistry, and theres no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.So, even though Kevin Costners a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs.",1497744000,"06 18, 2017",1.0,-1

"For starters, I want to say that I have never read Hellblazer's comic books - although I should have, since John Constantine is a product of Alan Moore's mind - so I'm not biased to criticize this movie based on the comic book series. This review is about the movie, and only the movie.I think Keanu Reeves is one of the worst mainstream Holywood actors - ""The devil's advocate"" is there to prove it - but after viewing the trailler of ""Constantine"" I intended to watch the movie, because battles between Heaven and Hell, CGI demons and, most of all, Rachel Weisz - I'll watch anything when she `s cast - have always attracted my attention.The trailler is great - maybe because Keanu Reeves' only lines are the whispering ""This is Constantine... John Constantine..."" - but the movie is a only a pale shadow of what's shown in the teaser. OK, there are some good visuals, the images of Hell are interesting and Miss Weisz is as beautiful as ever, and a competent actress also, carrying the weight of this flop in her back alone. But the good things stop there. The script is pathetic. There's no story. There's no final confrontation. Worst of all, there's no battle between Heaven and Hell, or Good and Evil. Character development is nill. We only know that Constantine... John Constantine has been to Hell and came back, and he's trying to beat the world record of most cigarretes smoked in a movie (record presently shared by William Hurt and Mel Gibson). That Chas character was pitiful, an expendable sidekick used to make the audience go mad at the Devil's son's harsh intentions. I don't remember any other characters. Oh, yes, the drunk priest and the voodoo club owner. And Tilda Swinton as the archangel Gabriel. Nevermind. Acting is completely lame - with the exception of Rachel Weisz. Keanu Reeves does the best that he can do, which is close to nothing. The Neo thing, I guess. The worst of all is Peter Stormare portraying the Devil like a circus buffoon. Even the visual effects are bad. Two ro three scenes at most, and they're all displayed in the trailler.Anyway, this movie is not good. This is no way to spend a hundred million dollars. I can understand Hallblazer's fans anger towards this movie. There's very little to be praised in ""Constantine"". I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Grade 3.5/10",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2.0,-1

"This is not only a terrible adaptation but a terrible movie nonetheless. This is the worst period movie I have ever seen. I love period movies so I watch them all the time and this makes even the cheapest Masterpiece Theater production look like Oscar-winning material.I am so tired of filmmakers remaking films that are already great. This movie is horrible. It's incredibly boring that you can't sit through it at once. The acting is draggy and laughable. I am sorry but a lot of today's so-called hot actors don't have the range or the talent to attempt something like this. Scarlett Johnansson and Natalie Portman might do well with a modern-day romantic comedy but they do not have the chops for a film like this. It's laughable to see them step in the shoes of all the great actresses who have played these roles. I mean no disrespect to these ladies but this film was over their heads. To me I didn't see them as the parts of Mary and Anne but as replicas of the actresses who'd played them in the past. I got the sense that Natalie and Scarlett were just trying to imitate the actresses who played these roles before, not truly conveying Mary and Anne as people.Eric Bana was the best actor in the film AND the king yet showed less than anyone.I don't even have the interest to go into what I didn't like about this movie because it was so pitiful. If you want to see the REAL deal when it comes to the legend behind this movie check out the amazing classics that got the job done:Anne of a Thousand DaysMary, Queen of ScottsAnd for great modern-day period films in general check out Cate Blanchett in the Elizabeth series. Now that's acting!As for The Other Boleyn Girl, it takes more than fake accents and dressing up in old century clothes to get the job done. Obviously the filmmakers of this movie went with who was popular, not the best talent.",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",1.0,-1

"This film, terribly written, directed and produced by some fool who I hope will never be heard from again, is atrocious. It purports to be the story of Catherine of Alexandria (who never existed) but doesn't even follow the absurdly silly legend. This clown perhaps read a comic book on the subject and then dumbed it down to the level of his own sub par mind. Aside from the fictional lead character, he throws in a few historical characters and gets absolutely everything completely wrong so there is no point going into particulars. It is all horribly written nonsense. It's full of laughably ludicrous delusions such as a group of middle aged (at best), quite overweight barbarian women warriors in Britain who are not only Christians but followers of She who never existed; in whose name they viciously slaughter the Roman legions there. It is sad that this is the last performance (other than a cameo in some other lousy film) by the great Peter O'Toole. It is a testament to his amazing brilliance that even when uttering this gibberish he is riveting and graces this idiocy with a gravitas and elegance which it in no way deserves. The actress who plays Catherine (variously and pointlessly called Catherine, Katerina and Ekaterina, sometimes by the same character) was obviously told by this mentally negligent ""writer/director"" that in order to show this nonexistent female Jesus' sanctity and knowledge of all things she should pretend to be a more than ordinarily brain dead zombie, reacting to everything, including torture, by not reacting at all. This is a shameful embarrassment; where bums like this jerk get money to make such garbage is a mystery. Catherine, before the Church went public about knowing that she was really just a dumb legend, was considered the patron saint of virgins. To phrase it as delicately as possible, this joke would have deflowered her; if, of course, she had ever existed, which she didn't. Based on ""quotes"" supposedly attributed to her used at the film's ending she should have been the patron saint of cheesy, inane platitudes. Amazon really has to start giving people the option of ""no stars"" and ""minus stars"".",1413158400,"10 13, 2014",1.0,-1

"Fasten your seat belts!  When I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was a David DeCoteau production. One of his gay but not really gay movies. Let's get to it. I don't care that every one of these are filmed in the same place (I morbidly watched some of the previews) after all this is super low budget stuff. The ""acting""....horrifying. The ""story""...was there one? I get the impression that the idea is to titillate gay men with there admittedly handsome and very nicely built young men (whose acting abilities are so stiff you could dive off them) spending 10 minutes each doing push ups, showering and rubbing himself (3 different guys). There is the terrible ""love interest' too, some chunky no talent blonde girl. Now the big question...why does this guy put some aging bad actress in just about every one of his movies (trailers again) this one is Darcy DeMoss????? for Friday the 13th part 6....REALLY???!!! does anyone remember her? does anyone care???

The effects are pretty good and the costumes are nice. The acting isn't Oscar material, but neither was the original. To be honest, if we buy this on DVD it will be after its been out a while and we can get a used copy fairly cheap. You might want to rent it before you commit to buying it at the ""new"" price.

"I own the older box set with the first 5 Rocky films included in it. I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.I have to give Stallone credit for trying to go somewhere new with the series, but this film just has too many clichs to keep it from being very good. Stallone's real life son is a terrible actor and is one of the reasons this film is the worst in the series. Overall the formula keeps you watching and the film is entertaining if you don't think about it too long.The DVD transfer on my edition is OK, but there is room for improvement.*** ADDED NOTE ***The worst film in this series is kind of unclear, as part's 4 or 5 could be viewed as the worst installment.

If a point can be made in 5 minutes, let's take 15 or 20 minutes to make it, and on and on.  The entire first half of the movie (of 2 hours and 15 minutes) was unnecessary to the rest of the film.  No explanation of what happened to her husband, in the second half of the film, after going on and on, and on and on, with the wedding party in the first half.

"Dark Ride (Craig Singer, 2006)When your big draw is that one of your cast members is Ashley Tisdale's sister, you're probably in big trouble. That said, Jennifer, Ashley's older sister, is marginally less annoying, and the movie, while derivative and schlocky, is not thoroughly unwatchable.The very thin plot: In 1989, a serial killer was discovered operating in a dark ride (what the rest of the world calls a tunnel of terror) in an amusement park in Asbury Park, NJ, and put in an institution. He breaks out fifteen years later and heads back to his old hunting grounds. On the same night, a group of kids on their way to spring break decide to spend the night in the same dark ride, which is scheduled to reopen three days hence.The movie suffers from two plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The first I can't say anything about without revealing some major spoilers, but the second I've already mentioned; how is it that no one figured out that an escaped serial killer would go back to the place where he'd committed his crimes? You'd think there would be a few uniformed people around over and above the security guards. (This would have actually worked in the film's favor, I think, as it would have increased the risk factor for the group of teens breaking into the place to spend the night there.) If things like that will kill your enjoyment of a movie, then you might as well stop reading now; they're there, and they're awful. Now, the many other things that might also kill your enjoyment of this movie. There's the acting, which ranges from mediocre (lead actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler of The Sopranos, whose role consists of either screaming or sleepwalking through her part) to the truly horrific (Alpha Dog's Alex Solowitz, who plays the group's driver, a stoner surfer-dude type; on the plus side, Solowitz is the spitting image of a young Ron Perelman). The special effects are, to put it tactfully, not special. The plot is tissue-paper thin, as it is with most slasher films, but there's not even an inkling of interesting ways to break out of the mold here; this is a straight slasher film of the type that hasn't been fresh since about the first Halloween film. About the only positive thing I can say is that at least, as with the horrible House of Wax remake from a few years ago, both the crew and the ""name"" star were smart enough to keep the most fun murder for said ""name"" star. (It almost takes the cheesiness out of the obligatory bra-flash shot Tisdale has at the beginning of the movie.)But, despite all this, as long as you turn your brain off, it's not something you'll find yourself actively hating. That doesn't come until afterwards, when you're wondering why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life on it. **",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2.0,-1
This movie is for adults. The story is very well staged and the fact that it goes back and forth into the past and present really tells the story well. I have seen other movies that try to do the same by going back and forth between the past and present and to tell you the truth lost me on the second time it went back to the past. The story at that point was not interesting enough for me. This movie kept me interested all throughout the movie. Kate was awesome. Great performance. She is a great actress. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes to enjoy well scripted movies. Enjoy.,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",5.0,1

"Even though I haven't read the book version of ""Left Behind"", the film was very well-made, and it was outstanding as well. I think Kirk Cameron gave a great performance in this film as well as the other actors because ""Left Behind"" sends a message to people all around the world, etc. I urge anyone that hasn't checked out ""Left Behind"" to go out and see it for themselves. I am going to own this movie, I don't care if I want to get it on DVD or video, I'm still going to get it. All I have to say is that ""Left Behind"" is among one of those movies that make you think and that you will have to watch it very carefully to find out what is going on throughout.",983404800,"03 1, 2001",5.0,1

"First, the good point of the movie - Streep's acting.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and she gives, as you would expect, a great performance.Now the bad points of the movie - everything else.  This movie was not at all what I was expecting.  If you're going into the theater looking for a movie on the history, life and career of Margaret Thatcher, you are going to be as bitterly disappointed as I was.The movie focuses on an elderly Thatcher, retired in her home and apparently losing her mind, as she spends a good deal of the movie conversing with the hallucination of her dead husband.  We get disjointed spurts of Thatcher's history thru a series of short flashbacks.  But these flashbacks offer no real insight into her career, certainly not any kind of cohesive history.  The flashbacks seem to be there only to highlight the regrets of an elderly Thatcher, tottering around her apartment alone, relegated to the sidelines by both family and friends alike.The movie is tedious and slow and before it was halfway over, I was bored.  I was also a little mad.Margaret Thatcher was the preeminent female figure for the better part of the 20th century: a political powerhouse.  She was the first modern woman to rise to a position of real power and influence.  Her career opened up a path for other women in politics and her decisions helped shaped the course of Europe.  The title of the movie is The Iron Lady and Thatcher, with all her good points and all her flaws, was powerful and strong and determined.  So it puzzled me why the movie seemed determined to turn her into a parody of female flaws and weaknesses.  She is portrayed as a selfish mother who chose career over family;  a distant wife, who takes her husband for granted until after he is dead; and a catty, overbearing woman who nags and bullies her constituents.It is a completely skewed portrayal of Thatcher - unflattering and I suspect for the most part, untrue.  This movie does not even come close to doing justice to the story of Margaret Thatcher.  It actually has a very anti-Thatcher, anti-woman vibe to it.  The writers have presented us with a morality play with a clear ""lesson"" woven in:  ""See!"", the movie seems to be saying, ""This is what happens to upstart women who abandon their families and their rightful place in pursuit of their career.  They end up old and alone and regretful.  Beware! Beware!""",1328227200,"02 3, 2012",1.0,-1

"From the executive producer of ""Drake & Josh"", ""iCarly"", ""Kenan & Kel"" and ""Zoey 101' comes a new series titled ""Victorious"", starring Victoria Justice (known for her role as Lola Martinez on ""Zoey 101') as Victoria ""Tori"" Vega.In ""Victorious"", the story focuses on Victoria ""Tori"" who has been accepted at Hollywood Arts High School, after taking her sister Trina's (played by Daniella Monet) place in a showcase. While Trina is known more for her drive to become an actress, her sister ""Tori"" has talent that she is not too conscious about and now trying to fit in her new school.She becomes friends with a talented musician Andre Harris (played by Leon Thomas III), a journalist/ventriloquist named Robbie Shapiro (played by Matt Bennett) and rival Jade West (played by Elizabeth Gillies) and her boyfriend Beck Oliver (played by Avan Jogia) and naive actress Cat Valentine (played by Ariana Grande).With the DVD release of ""Victorious: Season One, Volume Two"", included are 10 episodes from the first season plus the ""iCarly/Victorious"" special.""Victorious: Season One, Volume Two"" features the following episodes (spoilerless summaries):Note: Episodes listing on this DVD is not going by episode series #, but is going by production code #.DISC 1:  EPISODE 16: The Diddly-Bops - Tori and friends book a performance at a children's party, meanwhile Andre receives a call from a record producer.  EPISODE 12: Cat's New Boyfriend - Tori finds out that her ex-boyfriend Danny is dating Cat.  Meanwhile, Trina introduces her friends to fish that eats callus.  EPISODE 20: Sleepover at Sikowitz's - Sikowitz teaches the group a lesson about method acting.  EPISODE 18: The Wood - A new reality show called ""The Wood"" is being filmed at Hollywood Arts and the group end up on the show.  EPISODE 11: The Great Ping-Pong Scam - Tori wants to know why her friends are avoiding her.DISC 2:  EPISODE 8: Survival of the Hottest - A heat wave hits Los Angeles and Tori and friends decide to go to Venice Beach.  EPISODE 9: Wi-Fi in the Sky - When Tori and Trina's flight gets delayed, Tori uses web conferencing to work on a group project with her friends.  Special Guest: Perez Hilton  EPISODE 13-14: Freak the Freak Out - When Trina gets her wisdom tooth pulled off, Tori must take care of her because her parents leave for the weekend.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Victorious: Season One, Volume Two"" is presented in full screen, Dolby Digital (English Stereo). The series is shot via Digital and the picture quality is very good on DVD. I didn't notice any major artifacting or digital noise. But for the most part, fans should be pleased with the video and audio.There are no subtitles but closed captions are included.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Victorious: Season One, Volume Two"" comes with the following special features:  iCarly Crossover Special: iParty with Victorious - (1:09:50) When iCarly finds out that her boyfriend is dating Tori in Los Angeles, iCarly and friends travel to LA to confront her boyfriend and Tori.  Behind The Scenes: iParty with Victorious Mash-Up Performance - (1:22) Behind-the-scenes of the cast of ""iCarly"" and ""Victorious"" recording their music at the studio and scenes from the set of the special episode.  Music Video: Best Friend's Brother - (3:37) Featuring a music video featuring Victoria Justice.JUDGMENT CALL:""Victorious"" is a fun and entertaining show that isn't deep, just teenage fun with music and comedy!When I saw Victoria Justice appearing on ""iCarly"" last year, I had the feeling that Nickelodeon or even Dan Schneider was planning to use the actress for a new show and I was right. Victoria Justice who had starred on ""Zoey 101' and had short roles in various Schneider-related series has her chance to not just showcase her acting but also singing.And here we are with ""Victorious""!Because Dan Schneider's name is attached to this series, I know that the series has been compared to ""iCarly"" and when you make those comparisons, it makes it difficult because ""iCarly"" is such a popular show and if it doesn't measure up, some people tend to think its not a good show.With ""iCarly"", the series tends to focus on three friends (and one family member) and there is a good amount of character development within those four characters. It's a tight-knit group featuring tight-knit stories and with ""Victorious"", you have seven individuals and storylines that primarily focuses on Tori.In some way, because it's taking place at an art school, some people may feel that it's a contrived series that is a Nickelodeon take on entertainment ala ""Glee"" and some may even compare it to Disney's teenage film series such as ""High School Musical"" or the TV series ""Hannah Montana"" but in this case, it's not. It's a different type of series that takes on teen issues, friendships and wacky situations.The show is primarily about Tori Vega and while others may display their musical or acting chops, its a series about Tori and friends. No one breaks out in song or dance unless the situation calls for it but if anyone is doing any singing, it's Tori Vega and sometimes her very crazy sister Trina.I found the series to be fun and wacky at times. You have the teen drama, the teen angst and crazy moments, especially when it features ventriloquist Matt Bennett and his dummy Robbie or Tori's bratty older sister Trina.Also, it was cool to see the special ""iParty with Victorious"" included with this DVD release and the collaboration with Miranda Cosgrove and Victoria Justice once again was very cool!One thing I noticed about this second half of episodes is that the cast are more comfortable, especially with one another and they happen to be much more in sync.As ""Victorious"" is on its second season, it's important to note that this is the second half of the first season DVD release, not the complete first season.As for parents who are wondering if this is fine for children, for older children, I can say yes as there is no scenes that caused me to rethink of having my own son watching the series. But the series does focus on teenagers and it's a teen-driven comedy series. I didn't see any violence but kids who like to mimic what they say on TV, it's up to parent if they feel that the show is appropriate. I personally didn't find anything wrong with older children watching ""Victorious"" and may enjoy the music especially the comedy presented in the series.Overall, ""Victorious"" is a fun and enjoyable series and with the second half of the season, the episodes continue its fun and crazy hijinks but moreso, the acting is much better as the talent are now settled in.If you are a fan of ""Victorious"", this DVD is recommended!",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",4.0,1

"This is Quincy without Jack Klugman, who carried with him a natural appeal and the halo effect of his long association with The Odd Couple, opposite Tony Randall. Somehow he made a pain in the neck bearable. Jill Hennessy, however, at least for me, never having seen her previously, has no such aura. She comes through as a woman immature to a high degree.  Let me clarify that, she appears to be an excellent actress whose clear humanity, mostly in her relationship to the always superior Ken Howard, never counterbalances the sheer self-obsessed egotism of the role written for her. Perhaps my own experience within organizations has made me impervious to the virtues of people who screw up everything they touch because it is always them involved not the needs of the organization, their way, their desires, and never mind the trouble they cause everyone else. With the rest of the roles in the show, I am sympathetic and willing to take the bitter with the better (Goodman Ace). The shows are built around the customarily brilliant rebel finding quick solutions, with the help of her Dad, the retired police officer. The sequence of problem raised to problem solved is no worse and no better than the many such exhibitions we have had over the years. Well, at any rate, I have pretty nearly all seasons of the show (which I did not see on TV) on disc, and am hoping she matures considerably before too many seasons go by.",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2.0,-1

"I have mixed emotions about this movie. It is old and as such it has poor acting and many slow scenes. But in many ways this is worse than the normal old time movies As such I would give it only three stars.This is an older movie in black and white. Some of the actors in this movie are poor actors. Some of the actors show promise and with a little bit of training and effort you feel they could be better. Many of the scenes move slowly. I think that is just the way it was done back in the day. Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie one night when I was working on writing some lesson plans.

"""She's the greatest piece of ass on earth. With tits like that, you make allowances."" This crude logic proffered by Marilyn Monroe's (Michele Williams) publicist Arthur Jacobs (Toby Jones) sums up how much talent it takes to forge an acting career in Hollywood provided that you've got the right package of bodily goods to ware. Let's admit it: Marilyn probably didn't get her famous role in Some Like It Hot because of her ability to re-create a character; rather, it was one more fulfillment of the persona Hollywood had created for her: that of a coquette who could get leering men hot in the pants by making kissing gestures at them with her forefinger and doing a little bunny-hop dance number. Shallow? Sure. As the old saying goes, sex sells. Sadly, such shallowness also sums up Simon Curtis's My Week With Marilyn, a film that I'd expected much more from.Despite Williams's captivating and sympathetic performance as Marilyn, the film rambles and lectures, telling us little to nothing we didn't already know. It pretends to focus on a young starstruck university graduate and aspiring film-maker, Colin Clarke (Eddie Redmayne), and the halcyon time he spends with the most celebrated female sex symbol in movie history. Instead, we get a yawnworthy biopic that predictably shines the spotlight on the prima donna. We see Marilyn in all her forms: the consummate cocktease; the frazzled, incoherent druggie; the neurotic, insecure, catatonic mess; the unexpectedly intelligent woman who reads Joyce and Dostoevsky in her free time. In other words, we find out little more than we could have looked up in an encyclopedia or seen on a television retrospective. A good biopic should have more insight than that.Yet I think the film is indeed clumsily trying to do more than that. Depicting Marilyn's performance in an English movie, The Prince and the Showgirl, as she stars alongside the movie's director Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), it makes a heavy-handed contrast between the British and American schools of acting. Olivier, portrayed as an unrelenting taskmaster by Branagh, castigates Marilyn for her constant tardiness, breakings-down during rehearsals, and inability to understand her character. He discovers that Marilyn can only method-act in a role she's typecast for; she falls apart when she has to step into an unfamiliar character's shoes. She's a big star but not professionally trained and probably not natively gifted enough to compete with even the lowliest British character actor.Ironically, though, in My Week With Marilyn the British fall prey to the same hero worship of celebrities. The film's ponderous message boils down to little more than a simplistic observation of humanity's infatuation with stardom. Colin becomes so besotted with Marilyn that he breaks up his down-to earth relationship with Lucy (Emma Watson), the wardrobe assistant he's dating, in the laughably quixotic hope that Marilyn might forget her status as a famous personality and have a fling with a nobody. A co-actor, crone Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), builds up Marilyn's self-esteem, telling her that she can be a great actress despite her erratic behavior and incompetence. Even Olivier, despite growling that ""trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like trying to teach Urdu to a badger,"" is completely transfixed by her screen presence, even in her most fumbling and embarrassing moments.I, too, find her irresistible, but I'd chalk that up to my weakness as a typical lustful, cleavage-loving male. Vicariously living through a star is not my idea of a fulfilling life. Truth be told, Marilyn didn't want to be Marilyn either. ""I just wanted to be loved like a regular girl,"" she tells Colin in one of the film's more poignant moments. Unfortunately, the film never really delves deeper into Marilyn's emotional conflict or her apparent resentment at being manipulated by the movie establishment. We never get more than a superficial glimpse into what made Marilyn the person tick.If I have neglected to give poor Colin his due, it's because the film practically forgets about his troubles after his opening voiceover, in which he informs us that his family considers him a failure and doesn't approve of what they perceive as his frivolous career choice. It could have made for some interesting storytelling to explore his struggles alongside Marilyn's by showing us what they learn about themselves during their time together. It could have made their relationship seem plausible despite the very different worlds they come from. They've both pushed themselves into a career in the movies to try to conquer their nagging self-doubt. He's trying to escape his stuffy, elitist roots yet desperately wants his family to take notice of him; she wants men to love her more for her brains than her boobs. Their commonality is the alienation they feel as a result. Maybe they could be two kindred spirits after all.Unfortunately, though, character development is skirted over in My Week With Marilyn as it would be in any C-grade Hollywood production. Like the real Marilyn, this film is making money off a name, failing to supply the substance to warrant its success.J. Renoufcriticsloft.com",1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2.0,-1

"I had to wait for the DVD to be released on October 30th, but it arrived 3 days later. Not too shabby.My Vietnamese wife wanted to watch it immediately. As the movie progressed, I found it moving and very well made. The portions that use time-shifting require that you pay attention. My wife (from Can Tho) pointed out many instances where the story closely resembled the way her family members had left Vietnam or their experiences in the ""re-education"" camps. There was even a part where the North Vietnamese camp commander complains that he was mislead about his relatives poverty living in South Vietnam only to find during his first visit that they actually were better off than he was. The same story was related to me exactly years ago by a co-worker (also from Can Tho) who had spent time in a re-education camp. I have seen some a couple of the actresses in the equally moving ""3 Seasons (Ba Mua)"" and the cast of this movie is wonderful. I don't want to mention how the story pans out.

I haven't watched Speed in many years.  Now the timeless classic is on Blu-ray in all it's cinematic glory.  These movies make it clear why Blu-ray is what the director intended his movie to look like after all these years.  After all the movies that have come out recently that use computer graphics it's great to watch a movie that uses traditional special effects and stunts.Speed could be considered an epic in what it has done for action movies.  The sit on the edge non-stop unpredictable action that makes movies like this great.  The name of the movie implies what the movie is about.  Dennis Hopper plays a deranged man who is out to get what he believes is his.  He will do anything to get it including killing dozens of people.  The only thing that stands in his way is an action cop played by Keanu Reeves.Although some of the acting could be considered cheesy at parts it is still good.  Sandra Bullock does an excellent job in one her first big movies.  This movie did enough to put these stars on the blockbuster map.  Of course after watching the movie some of the scenes are very unrealistic but that is why you need to watch the movie without being a critic which is sometimes hard for me.  From the first minute on the action was intense and the movie stayed fun making this a movie I could watch over and over again as I already have.The Blu-ray version is excellent with a very refined picture and greatly improved sound.

"SPOILER WARNING. You know that tired plot wherein the lesbian dies and the bisexual woman goes back to men? Yup. That plot should have stopped at its acme, High Art, with Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Alas, this movie tries to put a fresh spin on the old disappointment.On the upside, the blond leading actress is quite decent - capable of behavioral nuances as her character develops, with a great expressive face - and very beautiful as a bonus. Her half of the all-too-brief sex scene is lusty and believable. When called upon to punch an aggressive male character at a later point, the blond lead is also credible. She's the best part of this movie, and I hope this actress appears in future movies of increasing quality.Ah, and the brunette actress: also very beautiful, but unfortunately, only capable of two expressions: 1) blank robot face, and 2) half-hearted terror. Very unconvincing, zero depth. A bit embarrassing to watch her wooden non-contributions to the sex scene, and to the ""love affair"" in general. Was it a love affair even? Wouldn't it have to be love or obsession that keeps the characters initially enmeshed with each other? Plot weaknesses, one of many. For example, the brunette actress's lowest point: as she's pursued by an assailant with a shotgun, she falls into a freshly un-dug grave, and writhes sexily at the bottom - in a push-up bra - instead of attempting to run further or fight back (though in previous scenes we've seen her be robust enough to swing an iron and slap off an attacker). Really? Not sure if this inconsistency is the actress or the script or both.The brunette lead does have a moment of faintly believable acting: seducing an older man over a cocktail, while sporting her ever-present pushup bra. Perhaps this is her comfort zone.Older bearded male lead: very solid, decent. Surprising nuances, in spite of heavy-handed foreshadowing pertaining to his ""craftiness"" as a character.Younger male supporting roles are both pretty hollow and forgettable.But this movie gets at least one point for the amount of violent payback coming from the female characters. It's been years since Thelma and Louise, but you still don't often see this kind of abused-but-empowered revenge outside of something like Haywire or a Tarantino movie. So, that was cool. Women convincingly throwing punches, riding motorcyles, swinging axes and firing shotguns should have made for an exciting thriller. Alas, the poor writing!I'd call the script medium-bad overall. Wooden exposition and breathy voiceover are beyond tiresome. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the development of the father/daughter conflict: the credibility of *both* characters is undermined as the plot progresses. The slow unspooling of murderous motives and mind games could have - and should have -  made a pretty exciting movie! Perhaps with tighter writing and a more convincing lesbian love affair? One can dream.",1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2.0,-1

I'm not a critic and I don't have the skills to judge anyone on any of those levels, besides I don't think I could do better, I don't know what they had to work with. So I'll just say I watched it, wasn't completely disappointed. Sure I hoped it would get scarier but it's a paranormal movie so they work with bumps and noises. There were parts that were kinda cool, and parts where I was like well why don't they have this or that. So I knew it had my attention.

"Perhaps because I wasn't expecting too much I was pleasantly surprised to see and enjoy this old film after all these years.  I believe I first saw this film on New York television featured on the Million Dollar Movie, and am quite certain that I did not catch this film in the theaters. While not the most memorable film it did include some nice features like the good model work, very fine painted backgrounds and beautiful scenery.The story held my interest and entertained to the end. The creature effects were accomplished with model work and props supported and animated by wire.  Here it suffered a bit but not much more than similar movies filmed within the limitations of a small budget.  It is definitely worth a look and gets three stars from me as decent early sci-fi which took advantage of lots of stock footage.",1222560000,"09 28, 2008",3.0,0

"I very rarely do this with my reviews, but to save you the time of reading about everything wrong with this movie, I'll give you a couple of words to sum it up at the start. This was just awful, really awful. In fact, it was so awful I would rather sit through a 1 and a half hour Matthew McConaughey movie. Now that brief hatred is over, I'll begin to tell you just exactly what I hated about this movie in separated paragraphs. Sort of like bullet points, only filled with 50% more hatred.The Story: Despite what some of the official plot summaries will have you believe, this is not based on the popular video game franchise. This is simply a movie that has stolen a title and character names in order to try and get more people stupid enough to be drawn in and watch this movie. Unfortunately I was stupid enough. The movie starts with Chun-Li narrating her childhood as she witnesses her father be kidnapped by Bison with the help of his head goon, Balrog. A few years later Chun-Li comes into possession of an ancient Chinese scroll which inspires Chun-Li to find her true self.Elsewhere, Bison is determined to take over Bangkok by firstly having the heads of the major criminal families murdered. Investigating Bison and the crime are clich American cop types, Charlie Nash & Maya Sunee. She's the feisty pretty one, and he's supposed to be the charming cool type but just ends up coming across as an even more terrible version of Keanu Reeves. Many following events lead to Chun-Li meeting a man who will teach her all she needs to know about finding her true self and eventually seeking revenge on BisonThe Fights: Of course, if you have a movie labelled with the Street Fighter logo, you will be forgiven for expecting a plethora of heart pounding, adrenaline rushed fight sequences. This is why those involved in making this movie can't use the Street Fighter name without fear of a hateful backlash as the fights were just terrible. They were short, badly filmed, badly choreographed and used too many wire supported moves to be even considered credible. Worse still was it didn't even think to utilise the many cool moves the characters had made famous in the video games.The Cast: OK, I'll admit that I can think of one good thing to say about this film and that is... I liked Neal McDonough as Bison and Michael Clark Duncan as Balrog. They seemed to look the part and if the movie makers didn't try their best to bring these characters and fit them into the real world, this movie could have worked on quite a few levels. Chris Klein as Nash was just horrible. I mentioned a more boring version of Keanu Reeves, and in retrospect, I think that was a bit cruel to Keanu Reeves. Chris Klein's performance in this movie can be used as a means of torture for Guantanamo Bay detainees. It can be used to interrogate suspected terrorists and can even be used to keep Rush Limbaugh at bay. Moon Bloodgood (WTF?) as Maya Sunee worked only as a decent amount of eye candy and nothing more. She served only that purpose and I think that if I were to indulge myself by watching just her scenes, I should fear that I may lose my sight.The main character of Chun-Li played by Kristin Kreuk was all wrong. I would much rather they had gone for a Chinese born, little known actress than this talentless shard of disappointment. Her fight sequences were dreadful and it is understandable why they didn't last too long as it's obvious she wouldn't have been up for the task. Her narrations made me want to beat her to death with my shoe, or continuously hope that Balrog would get it over with and throw her off a cliff. She was horrible, just horrible. She didn't look the part, didn't act the part and did I mention that she was just horrible? There was one point where they had a go at making her look like her video game counterpart, but she just didn't and I think the director would have had to be a complete dimwit not to notice that, but obviously it will have been too late into the film to recast it, so they stuck with the garbage.Oh and Taboo from Black Eyed Peas as Vega? What were they thinking?There's so much that I could ramble on about how this movie is so terrible, but I just don't have the time. All you need to know is that this is possibly the worst movie of the last 5 years, and there's some tough competition for that reward. I believe that this was meant to be the start of a series but hopefully, the financial failure of this will ensure that any sequels will not happen. The Street Fighter franchise is something held dear in many hearts, and this will only seek to tarnish that image. If they had taken the idea of a new Street Fighter movie and kept it in the same bizarre, cartoon world of the games and created a storyline around that, then there's no doubting that it would have been massively enjoyable. I liked the original Van Damme Street Fighter movie, as it was camp, fun and kept itself in that world. It didn't contain an ego and think it could adapt the characters for a real world movie, the makers of the original kept it in that world and didn't let their ego's influence any insane belief that they could create a Street Fighter story that would fix itself in the real world.Stay away from this, it's for the best.",1246147200,"06 28, 2009",1.0,-1

"Flesh eating zombie movies are always about the people trying to survive a zombie outbreak. If there's an exception, I haven't seen it.  Autumn focuses almost entirely on the humans. The zombies don't even pose a threat till sometime well into the second half. It's also a very low budget film with no great actors, make up, effects or action. Instead, this is an opportunity for a bunch of young film makers and actors to test their wings. I don't expect any of these young people to become household names, but this is still a decent effort. Better action would have made this a much more watchable movie, but I still liked it. Many scenes are very effective. Carradine must have appeared for moral support and to lend his name to help sell this film. If he got paid and his fee robbed the film makers of the money to make a better movie, they screwed up. I never heard of the novel. Maybe I'll read it someday.",1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2.0,-1

Vengeance Is Mine is the true story of a serial killer in Japan and is outstanding on many levels. The performance of the lead is inspired! The choices the actor makes to showcase every single part of the characters warped personality are done with complexity. And then the intimacy in which the film is filmed is disturbing and real. We get that this man is a complete person and we get he is very disturbed and we are with him the whole time; not on his side but in his mind without totally freaking out!

"My first viewing of this film in the cinema didn't leave a very positive impression. The lead actors are getting better with every film. Daniel Radcliffe is quite the leading man. I wish they'd given Rupert Grint more to do this time around. And Emma Watson is as luminous as always. What didn't work for me was the direction by David Yates. There's no doubting he's a competent director, but there's a sense of humor, flair and verve missing from his pedestrian direction.Fortunately, this film played much better on DVD. There are some great moments in this film. The Dementor attack. Loony...I mean Luna Lovegood's debut. Dumbledore's Army (a well-directed sequence). The battle between the Order and the Death Eaters. The climactic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end.The biggest problem I have with this film is that it's a series of great moments that can be enjoyed on a DVD. But they don't quite connect together for me to make a truly great film. What saves this film are the performances. The leads (obviously). Imelda Staunton as the odious Dolores Umbridge. But for me, the standout performance for best supporting actress this time around goes to Evanna Lynch. Where did they find this girl?!!? It's as though she fell out of the pages of the book.The other dissapointment with this DVD are the extras. I can't believe they wasted an entire extra disc on such threadbare offerings. We get 4 documentaries. Where are the cast interviews? The Directors Commentary? The spotlight on the new cast members? Compared to the great offerings on the Goblet of Fire disc, it's very dissapointing this time around.Still, if you're a fan of the films then this is going to be one you're adding to your collection, regardless.",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",4.0,1

"I was a rabid Dynasty fan during Seasons 1 - 4. When Pamela Sue Martin quit the show, I lost interest and was later chased away from the show by the dopey Season 6 storylines (fake Krystle, Alexis and King Galen, etc.). I never watched The Colbys, so I bought this on a lark to see the complete Dynasty universe. However, even as a Dynasty fan, I can see why this show was a dismal ratings failure.The Good:- Charlton Heston may be a ham, but hes excellent as patriarch Jason Colby. Totally exudes alpha male, yet he brings nuance to the role especially in his scenes with Francesca. You can tell hes just expiring with love even when he says nothing at all.- Barbara Stanwyck is a firecracker as Constance Colby. Smart, decent, but nobodys fool. Who wouldnt want to have an Aunt Connie in their corner? Unfortunately, Stanwyck (wisely) bailed after Season 1.- Ricardo Montalban steals almost every scene hes in with his suave Wrath of Khan vibe. His Zach Powers should be the primary villain, but the writers just have him idle around. He menaces but never does much actual damage.- Overall, there is just enough of the flavor of Dynasty to appeal to a fan.The Couldve Been Good:- Jeff (John James) should be the main character of The Colbys and our guide into this new family, just like Krystle (Linda Evans) was in the first two seasons of Dynasty. However, the tension created by Jeff's arrival is quickly resolved and he isn't given much to do. Big miss.- As Miles, Maxwell Caulfield creates a character with presence and energy, but his effectiveness is often undermined by his slender acting ability.- Sable should be deliciously wicked, but the writers never decide what to do with her. Is she a villain or a doormat? Her machinations always blow up in her face like shes Lucy Ricardo, and Stephanie Beechams pose-y acting is a liability.- Tracy Shoulda-Been-Cast-As-Fallon Scoggins is compelling as Monica, but in Season 1 shes mostly relegated to useless storylines in which she blathers about feminism. Fortunately, shes given much better material in Season 2. She has great chemistry with every actor she plays against, but I really loved her scenes with Heston.- The Hoyt Parker storyline. Big build up to a shocking reveal that then goesnowhere.The Ugly and Offensive:- All female characters not listed above. In Seasons 1-4 of Dynasty, the women are powerful, intelligent, and not defined by the men in their lives. In The Colbysits totally the opposite. Francesca, Fallon, Channing, Adrienne and Bliss are characters defined by their uterus. None of them have any purpose except to be over-emotional romantic partners and/or to navigate their ability/inability to be vessels of childbearing. The worst two examples deserve especial attention:- Fallon (Emma Samms). In Dynasty, Pamela Sue Martin invested Fallon with spirit, humor and intelligence. On the Colbys, Fallons written as a blubbering victim with a big rack. She cries or is about to cry in about 75% of the scenes shes in. The rest of the time she nags Jeff or is mentally unstable. Even if Fallon had been written well, its unlikely Samms could have done the role justice. As an actress, she has two facial expressions: straight hair and curly hair.- Francesca (Katherine Ross). A three-car pile-up of Ross narcoleptic acting, bad dialogue, and a non-entity of a character. Francesca has powerful men falling over themselves to marry her, yet she has the allure of a mud puddle. Shes a poor mother, mousy, indecisive, purposeless, and falls into bed - and therefore, of course, into love - with any man the forced storylines need her to be with. In Francesca, Ross and the writers have achieved the unprecedented feat of creating a woman that is at once promiscuous and frigid. How anyone can watch this annoying character and not be disgusted is beyond me, and yet we are (apparently) supposed to view Francesca as the heroine of the show. Utterly bizarre.The Colbys fails as a prime-time soap because it lacks the subversive edge, wicked humor, cutting dialogue and nuanced plotlines that Dynasty or Dallas originally brought to the soap genre. Instead The Colbys is written like a daytime soap. Its a fun time-waster if you're a Dynasty fan, but for anyone else its a sawdust cake slathered with a turpentine frosting of plotlines that all take 49 episodes to go nowhere.",1441324800,"09 4, 2015",2.0,-1

"In case you're wondering, the term bigamist is derived from the word bigamy, which means `The criminal offense of marrying one person while still legally married to another', a practice which still thrives in some parts of this country, particularly in the Salt Lake City area.  The Bigamist (1953), not to be confused with the Italian film Il Bigamo (1956), starring Marcello Mastroianni, is based on a story by Collier Young, who just happened to once be married to both the female costars of this film, but not at the same time.  The film, directed by Ida Lupino, stars Edmond O'Brien (D.O.A), Joan Fontaine (Suspicion, Ivanhoe), and Ida Lupino (High Sierra).  Also appearing is Kenneth Tobey (The Thing From Another World) and Edmund Gwenn, who appeared in a number of films, but is probably best remembered for his role as Kris Kringle in the holiday classic Miracle on 34th Street (1947).The film starts out with a couple, Harry (O'Brien) and Eve (Fontaine) Graham in the process of applying to adopt a child in the office of Mr. Jordan (Gwenn), who works for the state of California in the capacity of being a child welfare worker.  Things seem to be going well until Mr. Jordan presents documents to the couple that would allow for a background check, apparently because the state of California doesn't just give away parentless kids to any schlomo off the street.  The presentation of said documents elicits a pained look on Harry's face, one that doesn't go unnoticed by Mr. Jordan, and prompts him to initiate an extra thorough investigation into Harry's affairs, who's a traveling salesman by trade, maintaining offices in both San Francisco (that's where he and his wife Eve live), and also in Los Angeles.  Arriving in Los Angeles, Mr. Jordan makes the startling discover that Harry has another wife (GASP) and now has some serious `splaining' to do...which we get to hear as the film goes into a lengthy flashback.  Seems Harry, suffering from both marital issues and loneliness (he's on the road a lot), took up pitching woo to a woman named Phyllis (Lupino), but never intended it to go very far...until Phyllis found herself in a sticky predicament (can you guess what it was?  I'll give you a hint...it involved a bun and an oven).  Harry, being a standup guy, tries to do the right thing, but circumstances and complications stack themselves up in such a way as to limit his actions.  So the question now is what is to become of Harry, now that his secret is uncovered?While I enjoyed this film, I felt it had a few, relatively minor faults, and I'm not terribly big on the heavy melodrama (I was looking for something a bit more sensational).  As far as the subject matter, while it may have been taboo back in the 50's, it seems tame by today's standards (that's a scary thought).  I thought the film did a good job in presenting the material, as it seemed not to try and take one side or the other, but rather an objective overview how a relatively decent man could wind up in a situation like this (there was a little bit of heavy handed moralistic postulating here and there, but it was kept limited and didn't appear out of place due to the subject matter and the general consensus that's such behavior is pretty despicable)...O'Brien's character is well developed, a man struggling to do what he thinks is right, but finding himself sinking deeper and deeper into the sticky morass of socially unacceptable behavior.  While I appreciated his situation and his good intentions, I could never find myself developing any sense of sympathy for his character.  He had numerous opportunities to extricate himself before the situation became as bad as it did, but never followed through.  It's not that I'm a high-hatted, moralistic goodie goodie or anything like that, but I am a firm believer that when one makes ones bed, he must lie in it, not matter how uncomfortable.  He was the source of his own problems and had no one to blame beside himself.  I thought both Fontaine (who's incredibly hotsy totsy here) and Lupino did very well with their characters, creating a sort of ying and yang as the two, seemingly halves may have represented a whole woman to Harry...either that or he just had a whole lotta love to give...if it were me, having seen how well (or poorly) each of the women have aged over the years, I would have stuck with Ms. Fontaine, as she continued to retain her hottiness while Ms. Lupino acquired a Jabba-like appearance as the passage of time was not so good to her (little to do with the film, but I thought it worth mentioning).  As far as Ms. Lupino's direction (she was an extremely accomplished director and actress), it works well, and she keeps the story humming along, but it's not her best, when compared to her other release that same year in The Hitch-Hiker, which I would highly recommend.The picture quality on the Alpha Video release varies from decent to rough to rotten (there's points where frames are missing), and the audio is decent throughout.  The glossy DVD case would make it appear the film is in color, but it's in black and white (Alpha is known for creating especially attractive artwork for their generally substandard releases of films and television shows that have fallen into the public domain, meaning the copyright has expired, so any yahoo can release the material, which is often why you may see any number of different releases of the same film or TV show).  The extras include a graphic listing of other Alpha titles, and trailers for the films Just Add Pepper (2002), A Chronicle of Corpses (2000), Magdalen (1998), and Candy Van Dewd (2002).Cookieman108By the way, I think the film would have been much more effective with a less direct title...",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",3.0,0

"If I could give Movie 43 negative stars, I would. And I haven't even seen it. You don't have to see a movie to know that it is bad. Worse then bad, actually.In the words of critics: ""Take the nastiest, least-funny Saturday Night Live skit that's ever been produced, then add hundreds of profanities, bestiality, incest, testicles, bullying, full-frontal nudity, homophobic slurs, excrement fetishes, penis tattoos, prosthetic breasts dipped in guacamole..."" and ""Movie 43 is the Citizen Kane of awful"" and ""Being punched in the face was easier that watching this movie"" and ""Absolutely disgusting, nauseating, misogynistic, racist, cruel, void of any common sense..."" and ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""If I could round-up every copy of this trash, bury it in the depths of the earth for a thousand thousand years, exhume it, burn what's left, extinguish the flames with Tabasco sauce, reignite the ashes, pound the remains of it into fine powder with a hammer, and gather up that powder and blow it into the northern wind, I would.I seriously do not know how so many legitimate actors and actresses were roped into this travesty. Here is the only plausible theory that me, 43 NASA scientists, and a supercomputer came up with:Hugh Jackman's house was invaded, and his family was held at gunpoint to force him to do the film. Liev Schrieber, Naomi Watts, and Kate Winslet were sent fake scripts, and held hostage at gunpoint to prevent them from escaping from the film set. Emma Stone, Gerard Butler, and Chloe Grace Moretz were heavily drugged. Dennis Quaid was under hypnotic influence, as was Uma Thurman. Halle Berry was told to do the film or they would make a sequel to Catwoman. Faced with an impossible choice, she did what anyone would do. Movie 43 makes Catwoman look like The Dark Knight. Christopher Mintze-Plasse, Anna Faris, and Terrence Howard were blackmailed.That is all I can come up with. This trash has no redeeming factors. None at all.It is unfunny, stupid, filthy, disgusting, perverted garbage.On behalf of the many unfortunate souls who did not know what they were getting into when they saw this movie (if it can even be called that), I say this:DO NOT. WATCH. IT.As for my rating for this film, imagine the lowest, smallest number you can, multiply that by 6, take that number down 14 notches, and times that by 43. You are now half way to the number that I rate this film.As for thumbs, I would consider going under surgery involving a prototype genetically-modified super serum to grow more thumbs just so I could rate this film lower.3 thumbs down!",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",1.0,-1

I bought it based on the fine list of actresses: Mira Sorvino, Lauren Holly, Natalie Portman (about 13 in this one and the only bright spot in the whole movie), Uma Thurman etc. It takes place in the winter in Minnesota (who thinks up these things?). Uma Thurman (fine looking face) never takes her coat off in the whole movie. After I watched it, I looked at the DVD cover to see why I ever bought it (49 wasted) and it said on the cover that it was a comedy. Always up for a good comedy. I didn't know it was supposed to be funny. I am going to watch it again with new understanding, I hope. I had NO IDEA this was a funny movie. I should have read the cover before I watched it; I could have anticipated the clever nuances of humor so cleverly disguised as boring stupid garbage. Other people should be warned. This movie literally makes The Grass is Greener appear humorous in comparison.",1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2.0,-1

"I think the producers, directors, and actors weren't on the same page when they made this movie. It seemed like they were trying hard to go the Hangover route, but also trying to make it into a good-hearted comedy. Similar to the 40 year old virgin. which is probably why the two main guys were such geeks. I didn't find myself caring much about them and their situations.I don't mind the raunchy crude comedy, but if you are going to go that route. You need to go all the way and be over the top. The whole thing seemed too scripted and didn't really flow.Also, this movie should not be an hour and forty five minutes long. They need to have a director's cut and throw out about 20-30 minutes. I actually stopped it at an hour and thirty minutes.I should have stopped it a lot sooner.Although I didn't know what happened at the end and wasted all that time watching up to that point. I really couldn't care less, but If I had to guess, I'm sure I could figure out the ending.",1311638400,"07 26, 2011",1.0,-1

"Here's an interesting question - what do you have when you take a romantic comedy and forget to add any romance or comedy to it? You get Maid in Manhatten, that's what.I like J Lo, I actually think she has some redeeming qualities in the field of acting, unlike so many other pop stars turned actresses. This movie however, is barely tolerable to sit through. The only good thing about it is J Lo's natural charm and way.The plot to this movie is niether very interesting nor very creative and it falls way short of other romantic comedies.J Lo plays a poor maid who, through a series of accidents and circumstances, ends up falling for a rich politician staying at the hotel she works at. That is basically the entire plot, not much more meat there folks. And it doesnt get any better, the whole movie is dry, bland and lacks any character.Being male, you may think I am biased to the genre - but not so. I actually like a good romantic comedy, but this one will niether make you laugh, nor make you cry. There weren't any real funny parts in this movie, how can a romantic comedy forget to have any comedy???! And more-so the little romance there is, isn't very romantic. Nothing like when ""harry met sally"", or even ""you've got mail"".No - ""Maid in Manhatten"" simply lacks any of the things you watch this type of movie for. Hopefully J Lo's next movie will be better written and give her a better chance to show case her personality.",1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2.0,-1

I think Kate Hudson is an extremely talented actress (I thought she was OUTSTANDING in 'Almost Famous'), but I just couldn't take her in a movie where she's intentionally being annoying for an hour and a half.I kept thinking to myself ""I've dated people like this."" ""I've dated them and dumped them for these VERY REASONS."" ""So why am I watching this?  These character flaws are every bit as irritating now as they were then.""It just didn't do anything for me, if you need a date movie, there are a ton of other good movies out now to choose from instead.",1057363200,"07 5, 2003",1.0,-1

"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I usually enjoy Film Movement's releases on DVD, and own quite a few of their features, but this movie has to be the bottom of the barrel for them. Basically, it is about a Belarussian mother and her 13-year-old son living illegally in Belgium. The mother is caught by immigration enforcement agents on the street while bringing her son home from school on his birthday. Her son escapes; she is sent to a detention center to await extradition. She keeps her identity hidden (even assumes that of a fellow illegal immigrant), while stressfully worrying about being reunited with her child. There, she connects with other illegal immigrants.There are 3 major problems with this movie: 1) I had NO sympathy for the main character; 2) The audience is given her situation with NO background information about her or the mafia man who is harboring her. It simply tells some sort of story about how bad it is to be an immigrant in Belgium; and 3) The immigration problems in Belgium are unknown to me, and I am simply relying at taking the filmmakers' word on EVERYTHING that is put on the screen, especially ""true events"" that are being fictionalized.If you are from Europe, and know about the problems with illegal immigration in Belgium, then you'll probably ""get"" this movie. That aside, there is no character development, and EVERYTHING that happens to the main character is HER FAULT (except the obvious ""human rights"" violations). One is greatly mistaken if you make an equivalency to this movie and American movies about illegal immigration from Mexico (for that, see ""El Norte""). It is supposed to be a film about a mother and son and their separation, and it states so inside the dvd container. However, it merely becomes uninteresting and dull (propaganda?) rather quickly.The lead actress, Anne Coesens, seems to be constantly figuring out how to portray her character. She seems to be brooding and stares at what goes on around her. The most interesting, and better performed, characters in the movie (and they, too, are way underdeveloped) are the Chilean woman and her child, the female guard (a great acting performance), as well as the woman from Mali (of whom the story is partially based).There are much better, earlier movies (""Ali: Fear Eats Soul"" and ""Unveiled"" to name two) that deal with immigration problems in Europe. I am also disappointed by FM for releasing such a low-par feature, and of the many DVDs I own and have seen from this company, this one is on the bottom.Unfortunately, it is forgettable. Don't waste the $5+ on Amazon. 1 1/2 of 5 stars.",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",1.0,-1

"This is a typical Poverty Row production of the early 1930's.  It has a weak, implausible script, is cheaply made, with direction and photography that is pedestrian or worse, and the surviving print is blurry and dingy.  It does have a few points of interest:1) The story on which the screenplay is based is credited to Dashiell Hammett at the IMDB and Wikipedia.  However, no surviving print seems to have any writing credits at all (the film is in the public domain, and is available on YouTube and Archive.org).  Perhaps Hammett or his estate was able to get them removed at some point, or at least demand royalties for the use of his name.2) The only trace of Hammett is the way the character of the protagonist, played by Ralph Bellamy, is written: He is an ex-convict (although apparently an independently wealthy one), and is tough, taciturn, and somewhat bitter.  Bellamy plays him well. In fact, Bellamy is not just the best thing in the film, he is about the only good thing in the film.  This is not saying too much, given the kind of film it is, but he is surprising if you have only seen him in ""The Front Page"" and ""The Awful Truth"".3) This film seems to have been made before the Hollywood Production Code went into effect, yet released afterward.  The fairly explicit efforts of Melvyn Douglas's character to seduce Fay Wray's would not have been allowed under the Code, nor would Fay Wray's flimsy white evening gown, which nearly falls off her shoulder as she stumbles on her way to Bellamy's ""cabin"" (which, incidentally, appears to be a 15-room Tudor-style mansion).  Nor would the scene where Wray puts on a dress while wearing a low-cut slip - what's worse, in the same room as Bellamy, which he churlishly refuses to leave.  Yet it is said to have been released in late 1934, after the Code was in effect. From the fashions and film technique on display, I would say it could easily have been made as early as 1931, and simply sat on the shelf until point 4 kicked in:4) The film seems to have been released to capitalize on Fay Wray's stardom after ""King Kong"" hit it big in 1933.  Although Ralph Bellamy is the hero and the star, Wray is given top billing.  In the poster for the movie, seen above, only Wray is seen, looking much as she did in ""Kong"".  In the actual film, her hair is dark, almost black.  She is almost unrecognizable, except for her voice.5) The indoor scenes were shot at the old Biograph facilities in New York City.  Although Biograph was long gone, it's facilities survived under different ownership, used mainly for shooting short films starring performers based in NYC.  Outdoor scenes seem to have been shot silent and then had some sound dubbed in afterwards, increasing the dated feel.6) In case you are a big Melvyn Douglas fan, he has relatively little screen time.  Although he is the best actor in the film after Bellamy, he is given little to define his character.  With his natural attractiveness and charm, it becomes hard to understand why Wray's character is repulsed by him and attracted to Bellamy's rough, cranky, ex-con.  (Incidentally, Wray is very pretty in this movie, but not very much of an actress.)In conclusion, it is difficult to recommend anyone spending 69 minutes their life on this movie, unless they are very curious about Ralph Bellamy or Fay Wray.  As a pre-Code talky, it is a part of film history that lasted less than five years, but there are much better examples of that out there.",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",1.0,-1

The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic. Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by. There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.

Put Spielberg and Hanks together, along with an incredible pool of amazingly talented actors, and snippets of interviews with the actual soldiers and you have a masterpiece on your hands.I won't go much into descriptions, as most is in the main synopsis, and in most reviews. But I will say that I first watched this in its entirety about 15 years ago, when I was about 24. And I'm a female. And I'm not a big war movie person, or history buff. I watched one episode and was hooked. Binge watched til I was done. I've watched this entire series over 25 times from start to finish and it NEVER gets old.Its real, and honest and poignant and you get so swept up in it and feel like you know all the soldiers by time you've gone through the whole thing.Do not dismiss this... everyone should watch it.

However he was delighted with Robert Downey, Jr.s inspired performance in the title roll. All in all I think this is an exceptional well made film about one of the screen's greatest artist. The film does a good job of capture the life and times of Chaplin. The large list of actors do a good job and the film is beautifully photographed and wonderfully scored.

I do find that not having well established actors is a major benefit. The actors do a great job in their roles.

I won't tell you how the movie is but I'll tell you I think its horrible that we're not able to watch the movie without first being forced to watch ads for other movies.At least with a VCR tape you could fast forward or at the movies you can get some popcorn while you want.This DVD won't let you just put in the movie and play it.I'm not someone who would download or use illegal copies of movies but if the studios continue creating DVD's with no escape options I might change.,1079568000,"03 18, 2004",1.0,-1

"Like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O'Connor's funny man part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends.Whereas ""Singin' in the Rain' is a classic American movie musical, 'Cover Girl' is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn't very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after.Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's during the last years of her life.Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain'.The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2.0,-1

"Kill Bill, Volume 1 started was filled with a lot of energy, and Quentin Tarantino, seeing how it was his movie, definitely left his 'better' marks on it.  However, I could not fully get into the movie.  I know that Kill Bill is a homage to old Asian fighting movies, and spaghetti westerns, and in that light the movie flows, but from an average viewer standpoint who probably has not seen too many of those, it just is a lot of fighting with a lot, and a lot, of fake overdone bloody scenes.  Now, if you like Quentin then you will probably like this movie, because it is done in a very creative, yet still Quentin style.  I guess, the movie overall is okay, especially since they had the time to put in a creative anime sequence, but I still did not think too highly of the movie overall.",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",3.0,0

Some people say the acting is whats wrong with star wars but its not the acting and the actors its the choppy dialogue and scripts of the story.  That and the fact that there isn't a scene in the movie longer than 3 minutes makes it very hard to follow.

Glenn Close and Frank Langella are wasted in minor roles which are borderline anti-Semitic, and the whole thing feels like a fairy tale, predictable and thin.

"Back in the giddy Nineties I would have thought this was an artsy production but here at the end of the less impressionable Tens I found this to be an unpleasant movie, which means it succeeded in what it was supposed to be. Effectively conveying the miseries of a stressfully repetitive job, this film plodded through an hour and a half of mostly complaints and nagging and conveyed how awful working in a trendy little restaurant can be. While two of the staff at this unnamed Soho cafe slogged through in mature fashion, Neve Campbell's endlessly rude and self-pitying ""birthday gal"" character really wore me out fast. Never before on film have sweaty kitchen personnel and bored, job-loathing wait staff been portrayed like this, which doesn't always make for a nice viewing experience. If you need to, see I Really Hate My Job for the bizarre and oft-Googled nude scene, because frankly there isn't a lot else to give you a bang for your buck. If you do manage to sit through ninety minutes of would-be artists, actresses and writers wishing they were almost anyplace but where they are, well, you've earned the right to look at Julia Salinger's past-prime hangers.Four stars for good performances, two stars for plot, about negative five stars for enjoyability.",1261526400,"12 23, 2009",3.0,0

I don't find the F bomb offensive if used for emphasis, however, in this movie, it is used constantly and in the presence of small children. In fact, it is the first word spoken in the movie. This is not funny and not humor. The porno scene with Reynolds was simply foul. One of the reasons why I was so offended is that these two actors don't carry off this behavior.

"A lot of low rating reviews are too picky. They pick out a single thing in the movie and say the whole movie is bad. I was surprised by a well rounded fantasy story mixed in with Chinese folk-tale. You simply can not compare it to the Chinese movies. Those tend to be darker with complex relationship and usually the fighting and killing are ruthless with body parts getting ripped apart. Maybe that is why reviewers are saying this is more family friendly. Overall, the story was well thought out. The kung fu fighting scenes were intense and top quality. All actors did very well in portraying their characters. I never watched it because I heard bad reviews from critics when the movie came out. Finally saw it. And I was thoroughly entertained. In terms of showing it to kids, there are still some spots of violence that are not for kids. I probably would limit this movie for kids at least 14 years old. One more thing.

"I remember the first time that I saw the Howling back in the early 80s'. Back then it was unlike anything that I had ever seen and this opinion still holds almost 20 years later. The Howling is one of the few movies made back in the early 80s that does not have a ""cheese factor."" The story is genuine as far as horror. I think that the most frightening part of the movie is how Karen White (played by Dee Wallace Stone)is so vulnerable. The special effects look very real in the werewolf transformation. If the Howling were made by today's technology it would be ruined by cheap looking computer generated effects.There are very few horror movies that will stick with you for life. The Howling is one of the few that will!",1004659200,"11 2, 2001",4.0,1
"I think in this day and age we sometimes go to the movies with this clandestine idea that some movies are good for us.  Especially foreign films.  If Alec Guiness proved anything by playing Obi-Wan Kenobi, a British accent can make any amount of bad dialog, and half hearted plot points sound like their Shakespeare. Monty Python made a career of making  fart jokes seem ivy league.  As an American I've always found British cultural to be a bit high brow.  Fernando Meirelles new film THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a highbrow film that pretends to be good for you, but in the end is all together cheesy.Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a British diplomat who falls for Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a young student who becomes his wife.  When she is found dead on the side of the road brutally murdered Justin uncovers a mystery that challenges his friendships, and threatens his life.  What was Tessa involved in?  Was she having an affair with a young doctor?  Who's involved in her murder?  Was it an accident?  All these questions will be answered.  But I didn't buy the story at all.  So no amount of platitudes for the direction and acting could ever let me recommend it.Because the film is half baked.  It's got brilliant performances, tight and interesting direction and editing,  it's timely, and it has a polish and sheen of an Oscar caliber film.  But I kept asking myself why?  Why go through the trouble of crafting such an intricate mystery, only to bungle it with a half hearted and empty ending.  The film does a great job of showing some of the horrors that are going on in Africa and then ends on this note of preachy self-righteousness.I could rave about the performances for a whole page.  Fiennes and Weisz are fantastic.  Their chemistry works so well, almost too well.  Weisz is now becoming one of my most favorite actresses because she picks parts that have a lot of meat on them.  She could probably do a bunch of romantic comedies and be the British answer to Julia Roberts but hopefully she will chose not too.  Because there is an Academy Award waiting out there for her if she could just get the right part.As for Fiennes he always great.  I wanted to watch him in this film. Had THE CONSTANT GARDENER  been a movie more about the relationship and romance between Justin and Tessa I would have embraced it.  I would have praised the film because this is the only thing the film gets right.  But alas, the story gets in the way, and we're bogged down with content that supposed timely and important.  We get a mystery that depends on so many people,  the film has so many small characters we have to try and keep track of, and the conspiracy that is involved in the film is so convoluted and in the end it so mundane.  That you're left wonder just what was the point?  I left the theater saying to myself ""Who cares?""  If I wanted to be preached at about the horrors of corporations and how they're killing the third world, I'd go to a DNC Meeting or turn on Air America.A film can be timely.  A film can build a mystery.  A film can even attempt to showcase the horror in the world around us.  In the case of THE CONSTANT GARDNER a focus on human passion and heart was sorely missed.  Many people will like this film, they will praise it for what they perceive to be there.  But at the end of the day this is a film with powerful performances but no real heart.",1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2.0,-1

"I gave it two stars because it has atmosphere.  And that's all it has.  They could have at least written the script before they started shooting the movie--some scenes are obviously ad-libbed, the actors and actresses hoping it would come out looking original.  Not close and certainly no cigar.What we see here is the enraging waste of a potentially effective horror film.  I am proud to say I did not choose to rent this myself.  It was a negotiation gone horribly, horribly wrong.  When I saw the cover and read the plot I knew what to expect, and that is more or less what I got.Okay guys, make sure you've seen other horror movies, or you won't be able to connect the feeling of stunning unoriginality that drips from this sad little attempt at creepiness: ""The Omen"", ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""TheSixth Sense"", blah blah blah.  In order to understand the subplots see every stale, Lifetime TVish type excuse for a drama ever.  Read some August Derleth; not H.P. Lovecraft.The plot is Spooky is as Spooky does; a family moves into a large mansion in which something TRAGIC HAPPENED ONCE! Six children disappeared.  One escaped though.  Lo and behold, we have a morbid little tyke named Paul in the family moving in with the rest of the household.  Foreshadowing, anyone?The young teenage daughter, Regina, is unhappy with the move away from the states.  (Where the hell ARE these people, anyway?) She is delicate, pale and sickly, ergo made to be in gruesome situations where she becomes the affectionate heroine suddenly pulling through her veil of shyness.  The husband, Mark, is a nutcase who shouldn't be a free man anyway; abusing people and behaving so strangely that we wonder how he came to father children in the first place, with so much medication and all.  The mother is a debonaire, annoying woman who has no interest whatever in what's going on, only affecting an air of sophistication.The important one, of course, is Regina. She discovers through a weird old handicapped man that the house was once employed by cultists for the use of human sacrifice, namely children, and that she should get the ever scribbling young Paul out of the house as quickly as possible.  He has been obsessed with this case for years, but conveniently has done nothing about it till now.There is a diabolical old man who tries to allow Paul to be killed, of course.  There is a struggle.  SOME scenes gave me a jump, but not many.

The words ""Remastered Edition"" caught my eye and I ordered it -- without reading any reviews.Alas, I only read Carol K's review about the quality of this DVD after I opened it and tried to watch it.I agree with her. If this DVD was remastered, it was remastered from a terrible fourth- or fifth-generation VHS tape. What's more, the sound sync was off.

"Thief!  Plot is stolen from the 2003 French film Nathalie by Anne Fontaine with Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant.  In that film the plot was secondary (to my eyes anyway) to the exposure of Ms Beart (somewhat limited exposure), one of the most beautiful woman to ever appear in any film.  Thus, as this movie (Chloe) is only so-so at best, and it does not have any actress that even remotely approaches Ms Beart's beauty - it is gravely disappointing!So, forget this insignificant movie.  Instead search for and view, if you can find a copy, of Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse (The Beautiful Pain-in-the-Ass) with Emmanuelle Beart, Jane Birkin and Michel Piccoli.  This 1990 film is in French, make sure your version has ENGLISH subtitles as several versions do not (you may also need a PAL converting DVD player, but there is a Region 1 version).  It is about the agony of artistic creation and it allows full exposure of Ms Beart.  This is a four hour movie, but it goes by fast and at the end you will wish that you could spend more time with the movie's characters.  Michel Piccoli plays the artist (this is his best performance); Jane Birkin is the artist's wife and past muse; Emmanuelle Beart is the artist's model and present muse. It is Rivette's best movie (it is also his most conventional movie), even better than his more acclaimed masterpiece Celine and Julie go Boating.  Unfortunately it is very rare and very expensive; however it is also a great bargain as you will get more for your money than ever before.  While Ms Beart was very beautiful, her performance was also excellent as was Ms Birkin's.  Rivette is sometimes considered to be an experimental director and as such, to me, his characters are often stiff and unrealistic.  He is also considered to be a ""women's"" director (whatever that means).  But with La Belle Noiseuse he is at his best, handling his actors and the filming with perfection.  See this movie and you will understand relativity; four hours will fly by.",1462665600,"05 8, 2016",2.0,-1

"On another web site (which I won't mention here, though those who know me at all can guess which one I mean), I wrote a glowing review of this film, when of course I was in my formative and naiive years of film criticism, calling it the best teenage romance film I'd seen in years. A few nights ago I saw it again, and whew, I must've been out of my mind! Because, without proper analysis and proper depth, this film does indeed seem tricky, even enveloping. But, on a second viewing, I saw that it was nothing but tacky teenage romance mondure.Freddie Prinze Jr plays the son of a famous tv chef who meets and soon falls in love with a college student, played by Julia Stiles. The film then shows the expansion, unraveling, and coming-to-terms sections of their relationships, while each has their own group of friends to nibble at their ears.To be fair, the acting wasn't terrible to stand, and indeed Stiles is a competant enough actress to follow along with what she goes through. But Prinze, as well as other cast members, are never convincing enough to pull through the compost of script material that has been given to them. In fact, I wish I could give this film a 1.5 (not a 1, only because of Stiles and maybe a couple of scenes with Winkler).",1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2.0,-1

"We got this DVD as a hand-me-down from my child's older cousin. I really didn't expect a Barney movie to be at all watchable, but it is. My 2 year old absolutely loves this, so I've seen it repeatedly and don't suffer. It is a cute story with a decent children's plotline and is visually appealing. The young actors are good and quite likeable. It's not as enjoyable as any of the recent Disney or Pixar productions (which have a lot of comic turns for adults as well), but for small children it has everything; a touch of magic, adventure, comedy, warmth, and lively musical numbers. Adults won't love it, but your little ones will! Another asset that's important to me is that there are no real scary moments. My 2 year old is not ready for scares, and that's why he doesn't watch *my* favorite kid's movies yet (toy story, monsters inc, etc.), and he won't be able to enjoy those for a couple of years at least. This movie is exactly what I look for for him right now.",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",5.0,1

"I'm no stranger to bad action movies or horrible Independent film efforts. I'm reminded of Michael Dudikoff's wooden acting in the early American Ninja movies, and other would-be action stars in similar low-budget travesties. So, regardless of the pain, I make it a policy to always sit through the entire movie before writing a review. It honors the time and energy of every human that was involved with bringing the production to fruition, and once in a while, I am surprised as things turn around. This is not one of those times. After a promising opening sequence, this film suffers.As far as silver linings, the martial arts master - Mark Mikita - certainly has some moves. However, I don't think they were showcased very well with this production style, and he needs a lot more experience/coaching to develop a film presence and escape a robotic delivery of his lines. Conversely, Vivica Fox and Tom Sizemore do have acting skills. That helped. But both were ill-served with poor writing, limited sets, flat dialogue and a supporting cadre of ""raw"" actors and actresses, i.e., the goons. The editing style also seemed to omit brief parts of the story transitions, but it might just be that they were never filmed. Bai Ling, as the bodyguard, is a bit of a wild card. I've never seen this actress, though she clearly has other credits. Admittedly, she had a pleasant impact with her eyes and body language, but otherwise was pulled down by the surroundings. One last prop to Chris Jai Alex who played Sizemore's lead henchman... he did it well under the circumstances.Parental Advisory: No nudity or sex, but if this was a drinking game every time the word F**K was used, I'd be dead. You also have modest blood with a few of the fight scenes.Rating: Part of me wishes I hadn't stumbled upon this one, and I debated writing a review at all. However, what's done is done. I'm sure some folks will disagree, but on my Indie scale, this is barely a 2 out of 5. Yes, I've seen that many films over the years that were worse. Go into this one with very low expectations.",1432166400,"05 21, 2015",2.0,-1

While it is not quite what I expected on the romantic comedy end it is well worth watching and ranks up there with ""Waking Ned Divine"" in terms of the comedy and how it all plays out.

Like other great movies, I have seen the original 1967 film several times, but I have no intention of seeing the 2004 remake again.

Instead, it centered on two friends who had a kid together, and it was so predictable that the two would end up together that you wanted it to happen just so that the end of the movie would come sooner.  Yes, the acting was good (the reason for two stars instead of one), but the storyline was so lacking.  In fact, other than two friends who have a kid and fall in love, the story line was absent.  I guess that's why they decided to put in a bunch of filler scenes of parents getting frustrated while feeding or taking care of their kids.  Even if you're a big fan of the actors in it, unfortunately it's still not worth watching because you won't see the person you like enough.

I first saw the film several years ago at a drive-in theater in Georgia. I vividly recall that there were several nude and racy scenes and some fairly graphic violence, as well. Well, if you buy this DVD you can safely play it for the kids because all of the ""adult"" content is missing!! Also, the picture quality is absolutely dreadful and grainy and looks like it was copied from a very poor quality source; such as a copy made on VHS at home from a poor cable t.v. service!! Maybe one day Anchor Bay or someone else will give this film the treatment it deserves and release it in the original, complete, unedited and uncensored version.

"This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in ""Darling"" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her ""Princess Diana"" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in ""Georgy Girl"" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for ""The Sound of Music"" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of ""Mary Poppins,"" for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person. I'm not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry's book ""Alternate Oscars"" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was 'The British Invasion,' but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie's other film ""Doctor Zhivago"" which was T.S.O.M.'s rival and added to the fact that ""Zhivago"" had no acting nominations. There's another Oscar problem: They don't know when to be hip. Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with Harvey, or ""Modesty Blaise"" with Bogarde. In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar. Or as what Bogarde said to Christie: (a fitting way to close this review since that I end where it begins) ""I don't take taxis that are filled with whores!""",1161734400,"10 25, 2006",1.0,-1

"This movie..wow. The book by Verne was nice, and so was the beginning to this movie. I immediately got a horrible taste in my mouth when I saw them on this silly adventure in the railway cart. It was then that I knew that this movie was not a real adaption or a serious one but rather a spoof either intentional or not.Rather than going on about how much of a Disney movie it turned out to be with a good beginning, let me go over a few problems I had.1) When they were going out the water blast at the end, are you seriously telling me that they were perfectly aimed at the top to where they didn't clip the side and go tumbling up?2) The kid stored a prehistoric bird in his bag and it didn't die of either cramped space or something similar? You hide a bird in the small pocket of a bag and you tell me what happens.3) The graphics are worse than a movie made about 12 years before in Jurassic Park. Really?There are many more complaints. The 2 stars are for the beginning of the movie and the beautiful actress who, in real life, would NOT have fallen for the main character in such a short amount of time.Really, if you are a kid then maybe this movie might suffice. If you are an adult then no, this movie won't do. It feels rushed and we as viewers should demand better. How is it that Jurassic Park had better graphics than this movie?

A good movie essentially about a young Ernest Hemingway and how he had a brief love affair with an older American nurse. It is a well done movie that I greatly enjoyed and would recommend to anyone. Sandra Bullock is a wonderful actress she pulls off the role of a nurturing personality well. O'Donnell does a good job of portraying a young cocky Ernest Hemingway who originally is intent on trying to seduce a beautiful nurse. In a farewell to arms Hemingway wrote how a man who is trying to seduce a women is as if he were playing poker with her at first you're trying to win to sleep with her. But some where along the line you forget how the game started and you wind up falling in love with each other. Love is the enduring theme of this movie.

"IMPORTANT NOTE June 28,2013: For anyone on a budget or who only wants to purchase certain seasons of Dobie, SHOUT! is also selling all 4 Seasons of The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis separately. You can pre-order Season 1 now, as it will be released on September 10,2013. This is great of SHOUT! to also release the Seasons separately, as I have a few friends who are only interested in the early Seasons when Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld starred.The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a television series based on the collection of short stories of the same name by Max Shulman. The series revolved around typical 50's teenager Dobie Gillis, played by Dwayne Hickman, who wanted what every teenager dreams of having- popularity, money and beautiful girls. Dobie's best friend is not your typical 50's teenager, but the new teenage beatnik- Maynard G. Krebs played by Bob Denver. Dobie has to contend with his classmates- some are what he himself wants to be- such as the popular and wealthy Milton Armitage played by Warren Beatty or the spoiled rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr. played by Steven Franken. The prettiest girl in class is someone Dobie would adore to have as more than just his love interest- Thalia Menninger played by Tuesday Weld. The only thing keeping Thalia out of Dobie's grasp is his lack of money, which Thalia loves and has to have. Dobie's best female friend is brainy classmate Zelda Gilroy, who keeps him in reality with her keen observations on their teenage life. Dobie's parents who own a grocery store add a lot of comedy to his 50's life, as does best beatnik friend Maynard.The guest stars were always just as interesting as the cast. The wealthy mothers to Milton Armitage and Chatsworth Osborne Jr. were the same actress- Doris Packer. Since Milton and Chatsworth were cousins, their mothers were obviously sisters. William Schallert played Leander Pomfritt, the English teacher in both High School and Junior College. Jean Byron played mathematics teacher in both High School and Junior College also, and it is funny that Schallert and Byron ended up playing Patty Duke's parents following Dobie Gillis on The Patty Duke Show. Dobie's real life brother, Darryl Hickman played his brother Davey Gillis and Michael J. Pollard played Maynard's cousin Jerome Krebs. Raymond Bailey played the Dean, who many of you will recognize as Milbourne Drysdale from The Beverly Hillbillies. There was also quite a list of girl's Dobie would like to date on the series- Yvonne Craig (Batgirl), Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible, Space 1999),  Marlo Thomas, Sally Kellerman, Ellen Burstyn (when her name was McRae), Michele Lee, Cheryl Holdridge and many more.CBS aired the show from 1959 to 1963. Even though it was a big hit with the late 50's and early 60's teenagers, it never went too high in the Nielsen ratings. In Seasons 1 and 4 it never made the top 30, and in Seasons 2 and 3 it made #22 and #23. The first season focuses on Dobie in High School, the second season finds Dobie and Maynard joining the Army right out of High School, the third season finds Dobie and Maynard in Junior College, and you can tell from the last and fourth season that the writers were running out of ideas to keep the show going. In the last season, they actually wrote a show about being stuck together with one of those straw Chinese finger locks called The Beast With 20 Fingers. When the show began, you would always see Dobie posed as Rodin's The Thinker contemplating his newest teenage dilemma. The times may have changed, but Dobie's teenage dreams of popularity, money and beautiful girls has not.This is a wonderful, witty, funny and sharply written show that Dobie fans have been begging to be put on dvd for many long years. It's hard to believe that Shout! Factory is making all of our wishes come true on July 2, 2013, after such a long wait! The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a launch pad for many very young actors and actresses careers- Warren Beatty, Tuesday Weld, Michael J. Pollard, Yvonne Craig, Jack Albertson, Sally Kellerman and Michele Lee to name a few. A Million Thank You's Go to Shout! Factory for all their time and effort working on the Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis. I heard we will not only be getting all 4 seasons pristinely fixed up on dvd, but some fantastic bonus material as well! From All Of Us Dobie Fans- THANK YOU SHOUT!

"Review of LeprechaunHot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017Leprechaun was one of those awful, campy horror movies from the 1990s that everyone saw and no one wants to see again. It spawned a chain of even worse sequels; the original is really only memorable because it starred a pre-FRIENDS Jennifer Aniston. No one who saw this movie would have guessed the brunette barely-pretty teenager would become the most popular actress in America.I guess if you really want to see her before her glory days, you can rent this one. Or if watching really cheesy horror movies during Halloween is your thing. Other than that, its definitely one of those movies you can get away with pretending to have seen by just rolling your eyes at the mention of it.If you do like the Leprechaun franchise, there's a quadruple feature on Amazon for your enjoyment on Halloween or St. Patty's.",1497225600,"06 12, 2017",1.0,-1

"I've seen some bad acting, but I don't think an ""Oscar Winner"" should act this badly in a movie. Hallie Berry, who I like as an African American actress, did a horrible job as Catwoman. Really, she was following in the steps of the lovely Michelle Phieffer, Eartha Kitt, etc. These women were sexy as Catwoman and they were vicious. More importantly, they seem to do it effortlessly. You could tell Hallie was struggling to be sexy in this movie when it should have come off naturally.The villain was just all right, nothing special.At least the fight scene at the end was okay. But the premise and acting leaves much to be desired.",1212883200,"06 8, 2008",1.0,-1

"I am so glad this is available to Prime Members for free.  I would have been very upset if I paid for this TV series.  It was just plain boring.

Instead he came across like a Charlie Chaplin character who could not even express himself in words as well as the Chaplin character did with only facial expressions.

I waited for Wolfman with great anticipation to come out on DVD (I never go to the theater) and to sum up the film in two words; predictable and dull. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry on a wall. I was able to guess what the characters were about to say and what they were about to do.

"I truly have to agree with other reviews of this James Bond set Roger Moore first three movies as James Bond amazing movies, great plotline, and the opening scene on the movie The Spy Who Loved Me great camera working by the film crew.  The three movies in this set is Live and Let Die, The Man With The Golden Gun, and The Spy Who Loved Me.  Come next week I will have the whole James Bond collection from 1962-2015, out of the seven Bond films I have watch or re watched only didn't care for two of them which is pretty good.  In closing threw out the years there as been some great James Bond actors and at times just decent actors for the role, but if your a true fan of James Bond in general then you'll end up doing what I did and just collect the whole sets from year 1962 to 2015.",1487376000,"02 18, 2017",5.0,1

The first several episodes of this collection are the worst in this regard but the second half of the season starts to get closer to a finished product.If you are a hard core Simpsons fan and want to watch the evolution of the show then this disk is a great find.

"I absolutely LOVE Raoul Bova, I really enjoy Sarah Jessica Parker movies, and I'm a sucker for rom-coms and international romances...all things that should have made this movie a 5 star winner for me. This is the first--the FIRST--1 Star review I've ever given a movie, but I simply could find nothing good about it, except the fantastic countryside...which was RUINED by the terrible and repetitive harmonica-lead hillbilly soundtrack. They couldn't find some Italian music?-There was no chemistry between SJP and RB, so the romance - supposedly a long-lost-love - was completely unbelievable. Like someone else said, did these fabulous actors owe someone a favor????-The teenage daughter was so cliche it was painful to watch (although the actress was darling)-The soundtrack was obnoxious and repetitive - in fact, now we hum it as the theme song for any stupid moment in our lives. Seriously, it's like the song that never ends. It's a Small World in a fun house mirror. Terrible.-SJP hits RB...she HITS him in the face because she's being coy and cutesy. I HATE it when girls/women hit boys/men because they think it's cute. It's not.-I didn't cry. Not once. Out of the HUNDREDS of movies I've watched in my life, this is the ONLY rom-com I can remember in which I didn't shed a tear. BIG RED FLAG. Ask my kids.And that's just the first few things off the top of my head.I'm not kidding, people.

"I didn't like this film. The acting was good, but that wasn't the problem.  Believability was. I kept thinking that a huge amount of tragedies happened in a short period of time, so how did the family make it through 30 years of smooth sailing only to have more than half of the cast die or be almost dead in a week? Or have a psychotic breakdown or a death wish? And how did the characters rebound from each tragedy to the next while forgetting the one that preceded it? The son falls in love with an HIV positive woman, though attractive, who wasn't very nice. And he fell in love instantly.  How can these people be so literate, quoting serious literature, and make so many dumb mistakes. A second big problem is that no-one was really likable. Except Buck Henry's character. Great job by him btw. Aren't dying characters supposed to be likable on some level? And no-one had any sympathy for any of the soon to die. In fact, the dying people didn't express any fear. Only concern about the practical aspects of their dying. How did someone go from crazy/psychotic to normal in a week? How did that happen? And then the line at the end ""Stay out of mental hospitals"" (or whatever was said). Wha? The third problem, something that really bothered me was that stuff kept happening bad that we find out about some time after the event from some comment made by someone. The child and ex dying in a car accident and the lady dying of aids... there was no grieving at the time the things happened.  Hey! What happened to Frank Langella's wife in the last half of the movie while he was having sex with Uhura? Does that actress get paid for the whole movie or half? Sorry I don't remember any characters names. I didn't feel I knew enough about them to want to remember. Okay, so you take off in a train with somebody else's kid... isn't that kidnapping? Aren't there legal issues? Are there grandparents?  The washing thing seemed odd. All of that to use it as a device to see the dead kid. Puhleeze. It's not like they we having an affair... or maybe they cut that out of the movie. And why would the daughter call her father Scheherazade? That's a girl character.Best lines of the movie were both by Frank Langella. ""Jesus, it's like a movie."" (yeah, that's the problem).And my favorite, Frank Langella repeating back: ""Mona Dewaere doesn't like her hair."" (she should've stayed with the intergalactic whatchamacallits).There's a lot more I could criticize, but all I can say is they lost me. I'm done. I'm exhausted.",1407974400,"08 14, 2014",2.0,-1

"I only heard of it recently, so I bought the 2 seasons. I read the raving, glowing reviews beforehand, so after the first couple of discs, I was wondering if I'd been had. Everything has its fans, I thought. Twin Peaks it ain't! But around the latter second half of the first season, I got hooked. There are many characters and mysteries so it doesn't start picking up momentum initially. We switch back and forth between the Carnivale and the Preacher, not really understanding clearly the link. Plus, it takes a while for the preacher thing to start cooking and ditto with the Ben Hawkins storyline. But around the time that Brother Justin goes ""missing"" and Jonesy hooks up with Rita Sue, it starts cooking. By the time the Ben, Management, and Lodz storyline involving Ruthie kicks in I am just hooked to the story. I breezed right through the rest, all the way to the end.I am angry at the creators. The reason why HBO didn't release a 3 hour movie to wrap it up with was supposedly because the writer had too much story. Excuse me?! What kinda lazy, bollocks is that?! Editing is part of the job description! At least we got most of the major storylines wrapped up in Twin Peaks. Here nothing wrapped. It got even more unwrapped. But despite this, its worth watching anyway. I love some of the characters, which is a great compliment to any story. Jonesy was one of my absolute favorites (I was mortified in that horrifying scene- you know which one if you saw it) and why, oh why, did we end like we did with him? Nooooooo!!!!! Samson was awesome. I was so happy to see him again after TP. Brother Justin was just riveting and Iris was equally fasinating with her complex relationship with her brother. I did not care for the actress playing Sophie. I would have cast someone else. But she looks as odd as her character is, so it works anyway.I highly recommend viewing this and if you are like me, don't worry about the initial lag. Have faith. It will suddenly switch into gear and then you won't want it to ever end. An extra little shout out to the graphics when they showed the apocalyptic tree scenes. The foreshadowing scene in the cornfield was also riveting. Great artistic direction there.",1281830400,"08 15, 2010",5.0,1

"It is almost impossible to describe the film to someone who has not seen it.  I read a lot about it before watching it, so I knew what I was in for.  You have NEVER seen anything like this, so really you have to watch it.The premise and movie itself are so absurd.  You will find yourself checking your watch a lot during this film, and also questioning yourself ""did they really just say that?"". Excellent cast, but I am not sure they were the right ones for this film.  One bright spot was Colin Farrell, he was tremendous, transformed from any role I have ever seen him in.  The animal abuse will turn you off, I am sure many people stopped the film at that point.  I watched this on a 8 hour flight, so I didn't have much else to do, and once I started I wanted to see it to the end.  I think that if they toned down the movie and made it less dry and depressing, it could have been a winner. The absurd premise was so unique, but it went WAY too dark too many times.  I think this would have been an amazing Wes Anderson type dark comedy.",1474070400,"09 17, 2016",3.0,0

"Charlotte Gainsbourg, a talented actress, does have some balls.  She did this movie when she was 42 yrs old -- just had a baby -- and in Vol. 2 has many nude scenes.  Obviously, she looks facially and body-wise nothing like 23 yr old Stacy Martin who plays her character as a teenager.  The movie (Vol. 1 & 2) gets One Star for Charlotte's willingness to do whatever the director tells her to do -- which is very graphic, and not flattering.Other than that, the movie storyline is terrible.  Putting several nude bodies in a film does not make for an interesting plot or a ""cutting edge"" film..  As noted in other reviews, this movie is not artsy-fartsy, it is simply dull.PLOT SPOILERIn an interview for the release of the film, Gainsbourg claimed that she did none of the graphic sex scenes.  She said that it was in her contract that the director would use body doubles, and that there would be no attempt to intimidate her into doing those scenes.  Well, there is a scene where she puts a man's penis into her mouth.  Yes, it could be a fake penis, but it certainly looks like the real thing.  You be the judge -- if you must watch this movie.Also, why does the director have us sit through 4 hours of his movie, only to have a terrible contrived ending that bums the audience out?",1406505600,"07 28, 2014",1.0,-1

"As a horse-loving artist with a lifelong soft spot for American Girl, I was prepared to love this, but was I ever disappointed! It was not worth the money I spent to rent it.The acting is stiff, superficial, and overwrought throughout, though I think it's more a case of lousy, simplistic script-writing and awkward directing than of poor acting per se. The opening scene promises beautiful scenery, but many of the scenes are obviously faked, with the backdrops added in after filming. The scene in which Saige and her father ride in the balloon is particularly bad - it might as well be a low-budget black-and-white era film with a painted wooden backdrop. It's also obvious that Saige is not really riding the horse, and the riding scenes come off quite stilted and choppy. The lack of realism wouldn't fool any child old enough to be interested in this movie, I would think.As another reviewer mentioned, the film is full of inter-girl drama, all of which is extraordinarily petty, and which also seems far more middle-school than fourth-grade in nature. The Dylan character is a brat, pure and simple, and Tessa and Gabi have few redeeming qualities. The actress playing Saige is beautiful, and her face clearly conveys Saige's sensitivity, passion and sorrow in some scenes, but overall, the movie does her potential a disservice. Instead of inner strength and determination, her character seems to have an outsized helping of whiney-ness and fit-pitching. Even Jane Seymour does little to redeem the film, but again, I think the poor character development is more a flaw in the script and structure of the film itself.I developed real sympathy for none of the characters except MAYBE Saige, and I had to try to like her. And, while perhaps it's a misguided attempt to be realistic, but wouldn't it be better if AG showed NICE little girls, who didn't have cat fights as if it were ""normal""? I think AG missed a beautiful chance to work with some cute actresses and some breathtaking scenery and art. Instead of portraying the passions and internal complexities of a sweet, strong, endearing introverted girl, they portrayed the external cattiness, domination, and competition of middle school brats. The end ""art show"" is too polished for supposed kids' work. It's like they grafted a vapid, overly glitzy Disney channel-meets-Glee pop dance routine onto a stilted script and sold it as a heartwarming, edifying movie. Such a disappointment.",1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2.0,-1

REALLY, no one cares about this character.Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind?) So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?If you have NOTHING else to do, watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good, and then move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just slow and depressing.

The comedy was good at the beginning but got very old after awhile.  If they would have improved the comedy and cut out the stale jokes it could have been a fun movie.",1355616000,"12 16, 2012",3.0,0

"I thought eventually we as the audience would learn what ""traditions"" and ""rules"" are in place, but we never do. I suppose we could guess at a couple but, some of the hints at these ""rules"" and ""traditions"" don't make sense. I was very confused at what the whole point was. Cannibalism was greatly exaggerated throughout the entire movie and some of it was an ""seriously?"" moment. Example....you find out something life changing and act as if you were being told a story or that the weather is turning bad. That's the reaction? I was seriously disappointed at what could have been a decent enough movie. I love amateur movies and I even like a lot of low budget films and I try to be fair considering what the director and actors and actresses work with.

"I had my doubts about Keanu's ability to move into a dramtic role. But then again I'm deaf so I have to wait for movies to come out on DVD and subtitled. I sure felt his pain throughout the film as he portrayed the emotion quite well. He also did a wonderful job of displaying grace under fire and Love through the flame of directed hate and anger towards him.This is a wonderful movie and being a guy I had to ask myself what would I do in his position? Pretty much what he did sadly even though I wanted the best for him and Aitana Snchez-Gijn who just blew my socks off. This actress knows how to use a look in the most subtle way saying volumes without a whisper.If you are a guy and watch this and if you have not shed a tear of joy by the end of the movie then your heart is stone cold. ( NO I'm not fricken gay) The core of the movie is about Love, Love of Family, honor and dropping the macho crap and learning to love.There's nothing bad about this movie. It has everythting good in it.  I liked it across the board. I'll watch it again and again.It was wonderfull to see Anthony Quinn in this film as he used his age to the characters benefit. The old mans wisdom was as heart warming as can be. I don't think anyone else other than Anthony Quinn could have pulled this off near as well.

Again, I realize it's a zombie movie, but some dialogue is better than none, especially when the first 20 minutes are flat-out boring.The only reasons I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the setting was different and the special effects for a low-budget film were pretty good.

"It really isn't fair that an awful film like License to Wed received a wide theatrical release while Wedding Daze a.k.a. The Pleasure of Your Company is released direct-to-video (it did receive a limited theatrical release in England in 2007). Both films are romantic comedies about the trials and tribulations of young couples getting married. It's not surprising that this happened because Licensed has a big name star like Robin Williams to help sell it while Daze has a once bankable star (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>'s Jason Biggs) and an up-and-coming actress (Isla Fisher). Both films feature broad comedy mixed with the occasional gross-out gag but License resorts to tired, clich jokes that we've seen a million times before while Daze features quirky humour courtesy of The State alumni Michael Ian Black.Jason Biggs seems to be channeling the nervous energy of Ben Stiller and the natural likability of Matthew Broderick. His character is a romantic who can't let go of the past. Isla Fisher is her usual charming self with an engaging smile that lights up any room she's in. She's adorable as a girl who wants to lead a more spontaneous life. It turns out that she is just as much a romantic as Anderson. Biggs and Fisher are both adept at physical comedy and are not afraid to look silly. They also have excellent chemistry together and you really root for their characters to succeed.Wedding Daze hits the usual plot points - spending the first night together and meeting the parents - and gives them an off-kilter spin, like Katie's father who makes orthodox toys for Jewish kids or Anderson's father passing on his cock ring to his son.

Disney needs to follow the original step by step rather then bring a classic to life from an animation and do something completely different.  They should have chosen actress's that don't look the best yet have exellent acting skills for the step sisters and Goldie Hawn as the step mother so you have the right energy through the film against Cinderella rather then destroy what could've been the greatest instant classic ever made.  They could still have the actor who was the prince and actress who potrayed Ciderella.  But no this is more of a LIONS GATE or some other film makers look at an attempt to Cinderella yet it is not it is a Disney and a poor excuse at that.  Malefcent was great since it showed the other side to Sleeping Beauty.  Like everyone said costumes were great story poor and choice of secondary actors and actresses poor.  Plus too much off the original story line like they did with 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians that were remakes brought from animation to life.  They were both disappointing films by Disney but 101 was decent but not great.  Disney made their mark in the realm of fairy tales and need to stick with what was already made and just add 2-3 more scenes to surprise the audience yet bring joy.  Also make the animals talk if the original animated version had the animals talking or singing so that the movie takes your breath away and sweeps you right off your own two feet.,1502582400,"08 13, 2017",1.0,-1

"One of Lewton's more underrated films, ""The 7th Victim"" is an unconventional noir with much to offer. Beginning with the disappearance of Jacqueline Gibson (Jean Brooks) older sister of schoolgirl Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter in her first feature role) we are almost immediately immersed in the mysterious world of modern-day Satanists, a Rosemary's Baby-esque group of eccentrics who worship the Dark Lord's majesty and power. Mix that with garbled psychology as touted by Dr. Judd (Tom Conway) and you're in for a fair romp amidst the darkness lurking at the edges of everyday life. (And yes, the self-same Dr. J as seen in Lewton's ""Cat People."" Apparently he gets around.)Mary leaves school to search for her sister among the shadows of a long-vanished Greenwich Village, NYC. She visits the cosmetic plant her sister owned only to discover Jacqueline has sold it to a Mrs. Redi (Mary Newton) who remains close-lipped and perfunctory with her explanation of Jacqueline's months-long absence. Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), Jacqueline's SO, is also desperate to find her. Rounding out those who search for Jacqueline is Jason Hoag (Erford Gage) a poet stymied in his work for a decade following the disappearance of his true love and muse.Subplots involve a detective (Richard Davies) and his demise, a morbid subway scene, and a shower scene predating Psycho by almost twenty years. As it is in Lewton's work small players make a big impression. Most noteworthy are dying neighbor Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), and beautician Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell) whose devotion to Jacqueline hints of homoeroticism.""The 7th Victim"" features a Lewton walk to end all Lewton walks interspersed with not one but two Lewton buses. The film is worth viewing for that alone and also for a look at statuesque Bettie Page ringer actress Jean Brooks.

So, she fits right in with the other teens in the van.When all of them arrive to the carnival and go inside, this is when everything goes crazy.  All the teens one by one fall victim to this crazy maniac who likes to kill people in creative ways.  This has all been done a million times in other similar movies so I don't need to explain all the creative ways the teens die.One thing that was disappointing was how so much time was devoted to building up suspense, and then when the action/killing segments arrived, there wasn't much movie time left so all the killings happened quite fast.  Like in a matter of 30 minutes.  Some of the deaths were quite disgusting in the way they were extremely bloody and violent while sex acts were taking place.I was surprised that the one girl died, because I thought they were building to some kind of relationship involving the other teen.  It doesn't matter, because this is just another horror movie you can either watch and enjoy, or skip and forget about it.  It doesn't matter.",1199491200,"01 5, 2008",3.0,0
"A very formulaic film.  It has one of the most disappointing endings in anime.  Very non-climatic.  The animation is beautiful, but I'm a person who believes that if you don't have a strong story to back that animation up...it doesn't matter how good it looks.  This movie doesn't really have a good story.  Rent it or skip it, but don't buy it.",986860800,"04 10, 2001",1.0,-1

"Slow, tedious, boring.  Take a fairly simple Science Fiction idea of the earth under threat of being destroyed and make it into an uninteresting bore-fest.  If a point can be made in 5 minutes, let's take 15 or 20 minutes to make it, and on and on.  The entire first half of the movie (of 2 hours and 15 minutes) was unnecessary to the rest of the film.  No explanation of what happened to her husband, in the second half of the film, after going on and on, and on and on, with the wedding party in the first half.  The only redeeming part of the film is Kirsten Dunst finally getting topless in two scenes, and the last 30 seconds of the film, but, beyond that, this movie is a total waste of time.  Very good actors are simply wasted by the Writer/Director of this mess.",1482969600,"12 29, 2016",1.0,-1

"The title of my review alone should tell you what a bad movie we have here.How this movie stinks... let me count the ways:1. The name of the movie itself is ridiculous. 10th & Wolf is a quiet, lower-middle class residential corner in South Philly. It is certainly not the gritty, gray hub of underworld crime.2. At the beginning of the film, the lead character, Tommy (James Marsden), is a Marine in the brig, facing a life sentence. What for? For  hitting an MP and stealing an officer's jeep!3. When he arrives ""home to Philadelphia,"" Tommy jumps off a Pittsburgh Transit bus!4. Also take notice of all those hilly streets, which scream ""Hey! Look at me in wonderful, downtown Pittsburgh!"" (Philly is as flat as an ironing board).5. The only true Philly street actually used here is the corner of 9th & South; which, by the way, is 20 blocks away from the true 10th & Wolf, and looks nothing like that neighborhood.6. The 1984 flashback scene has the young Tommy & Joey, sitting in the (non-existent) 10th & Wolf Diner listening to the J. Geils Band and the Stray Cats. As anyone growing up in South Philly at that time knows, the problem with this scene lies in the simple fact that no self-respecting Italian cornerboy back then was listening to this or much of any other Rock music. The soundtrack to South Philly corner life for Italian kids in the '80s was Dance/Club music and what we now call ""Old School"" Hip Hop. Saturday night was usually Oldies night, when everybody tried to show off just how much Doo-Wop or Motown they knew.7. Giovanni Ribisi playing the role of Joey, the head of a mob outfit, is simply laughable.8. Mob leaders do not often do their own hits and dirty work, they have other guys to do it for them.9. What did the makers of this movie hope to accomplish by having so much well-known talent walking in and out of scenes, wasting their talents?Brian Dennehy, Dennis Hopper, and Leo Rossi contribute nothing to this film - and it's certainly not their fault. Worst of all, it was was quite sad to see a veteran actress like the still-beautiful Leslie Ann Warren kept in a dingy rowhome, dancing to old Disco songs in tacky MILF outfits throughtout this sorry hackjob of a mob flick.10. Speaking of actors and actresses: Where are those who actually come from South Philly (geez... or at least from Jersey or New York even)? Only the minor character of Rocco is played by a true South Philly Joey. This happens to be Tony Luke, Jr. (the real-life cheese steak and sandwich honcho who, by the way, happened to have attended the same grade school that I did: St. Nicholas of Tolentine) Perhaps such an absence of locally born talent helps to explain why the actors mispronounce the derogatory term for Sicilians (it is pronounced ""sidge-ee,"" not ""see-jee"") and fail to mention the correct local parish for this so-called famous corner of ""10th & Wolf,"" - that would be Epiphany of Our Lord, not Sacred Heart (which is all the way down on 3rd & Reed Streets).I can go on with a couple of dozen more errors, discrepencies, and things I've observed to be amateurish, fake, or just simply goofy; however, I'll consider your valuable time and just finish this out by saying that this is a bad movie. A piece of moviemaking that attempted to take some of the best bits of mob movie classics and, stuffing itself full of gory violence and over-acting, hope we'll buy the botched finished product as intense urban drama.That it only has 10 other reviews posted here should also help confirm my condemnation.",1179619200,"05 20, 2007",1.0,-1

"Fiesty Federal Investigator is hot on the trail of a husband-killer, but to catch her she has to think like the killer thinks and play her game...I would love to see a rematch of these two dynamite femme stars, Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. The movie world needs them. Russell, as an actress, generally lacks Winger's inner-fire, but some of her close-ups are more revealing than her dialogue anyway(watch for the scene on the beach after the scuba diving accident). In 1987, this was considered a modest hit which got generally good reviews(Roger Ebert panned it, however). So it's fair to say the movie is highly underrated and should be seen by anyone who loves a good mystery or a great acting match between two top-flight stars. Supporting performances are also very good, and the direction is tricky & tight right up until the final scene(which seems a little rushed). Great cinematography, suspenseful music by Michael Small, incredible Winger & Russell!",1113177600,"04 11, 2005",5.0,1

"The 1993 version of Nicholas Nickleby should not be considered.  It is not merely the snake-faced appearance of the actor who plays the lead, nor the fact that he speaks as though he has a bad cold with a stuffed-up nose.  But he is also a contemporary character, not a nineteenth-century character.  And that's just for starters.The 2002 version is not bad.  With widescreen and surround sound and good photography, this is a good production for what appears to be a limited budget.  Problems begin with the casting.  The American actor who plays the lead speaks in a carefully articulated generic English accent, but that won't do, nor the fact that his manner and mannerisms are those of a contemporary rather than a period character.  Christopher Plummer is an accomplished actor, but his effort here seems half-hearted, as though he didn't think much of this production.  The actor who plays Smike mumbles his lines as though he is bucking for the role of Hamlet.  The story is powerful enough that this movie is not a washout, but none of it is particularly well done.What the above versions lack is comedy.  Dickens was fond of mixing hilarious comedy with the most heart-rending drama, and Nicholas Nickleby is no exception.  The above versions are merely drama.  But the biggest crime is in the character of Mrs. Nickleby.  Mrs. Nickleby is one of the great comic characters of world literature.  Unfortunately, she is also politically incorrect.  The above versions simply throw out her character and replace it with a blah nonentity.The 1977 version.  At over 5 hours, this version brings in more of the minor characters of this long story and treats the story according to the book.  As often with the BBC, there is lavish attention to sets and their accuracy and little attention to anything else.  The music is nonexistent.  The photography is not bad indoors but the few outdoor scenes are overexposed.  And the acting is marginal at best.  Nigel Havers is much too old for the role of Nicholas but does an adequate job.  The ending is satisfying.  All in all, well worth seeing, especially for readers of the book.  The emphasis is on drama.  There is humor in the character of Mrs. Nickleby and an attempt at humor in a couple of the minor characters.The 1947 version was made before the Dhimmist ideology came to dominate movie-making, and here we find Mrs. Nickleby in all her mind-boggling glory.  In fact, all of the characters in this movie have that Dickensian edge that makes them larger, or at least more effective, than life.  Good scripting and good direction make for a hard-hitting, heart-touching and occasionally side-splitting experience.  The actors and actresses don't TRY to speak in an upper-middle-class British accent; they simply speak and behave as they normally would and it is true to the period.  The pace is fast, and the script had to streamline some of the events, but all of the major events are here and are effectively presented.  The ending is far more dramatic than in the other versions.",1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2.0,-1

"The fourth season of I Love Lucy is certainly a golden one. In this one, Ricky Ricardo lives out his dreams of becoming an actor when he is asked to star in a big-budget Hollywood movie. So, he, along with Lucy, Ethel, Fred, Little Ricky and Lucy's mother. In Hollywood, the gang gets wrapped up in all kinds of wacky schemes including Lucy getting to become a supermodel in the Hollywood Wives fashion show, Lucy getting a part as a murdered showgirl in an MGM musical, Lucy's attempts to meet Cornel Wilde and Ricky getting the chance to get some publicity in Hedda Hopper's gossip column. In addition to all of the L.A. craziness, weird things happen on the way to L.A. such as the gang being forced to sleep in an ugly cabin next to an old, rundown cafe in Cincinnati, another meeting with Tennessee Ernie Ford and a visit to Ethel's hometown Albuquerque, New Mexico where everyone there is told that Ethel is an aspiring actress. I could go on and on, but if I do, then this review would eventually get boring. So just buy the fourth season and find out for yourself what happens next.",1352764800,"11 13, 2012",5.0,1

The shocking ending was deleted on this remake ( too bad). You need to be carefully when you want to do a new version of a timeless classic , there are some particular points in the movie that you want to see again to see if the new version can blow your mind. The only two things that were interesting in the movie , was the birth of Carrie at the beginning of the movie  , that explain the strange  relation between Carrie and her mother. The other thing was Carrie's mother character, was very well done and  different from the original movie ,  you can see in her the real pain and motivation to keep Carrie very close to her in a sick way.

"To have been a movie made within the last couple of years, the ice creature was pretty sorry looking.

"Synopsis: a group of SWAT-like cops in Indonesia go into a multistoried tenement in order to capture a drug lord, living near the top floor. The drug lord is played by veteran actor Ray Sahetapy, nowadays looking nothing like his former handsome self. The building has more criminals living there than an American HUD housing project. A third of the way up, surprise is lost. The drug lord, who has cameras and speakers in every floor, invites everyone to take out the intruders whereupon a slaughter begins with automatic weapons, knives, machetes, etc. The cops are rapidly eliminated except for a handful, who cannot call for backup and who run out of ammunition, at which point it's martial arts time, as they try to extricate themselves out of the trap. The violence is nonstop. There is little characterization and the film is just a vehicle for martial arts. I have to admit that most of the fights are pretty stimulating and somewhat believable. Until near the end, there is one long, long, long, LONG scene where nonstop assaults take place (I went out for popcorn, bored, came back, and it was still going on). After sustaining all this damage, the protagonists just simply walk out of the room.Aside from the fact that it was filmed with the technical expertise that Indonesian film industry usually lacks (although they have some very good, overlooked, actors and actresses), mainly due to the writer/director being Gareth Evans, I really don't see why it had so many good reviews in the US. Oh, well.",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2.0,-1
This series wasn't too bad but it was more like part soft porn soap opera and part cheesy romance novel. It would've been much better if most of the explicit sex scenes were removed entirely and they let the story line and the actors/actresses be the focus.

The plot of this film has been done a million times before and so much better. I would have been really disappointed had I paid to see this at the movies. I didn't think enough suspense was built. I didn't really feel the chemistry between the actors. There was no twist to the movie so it was totally predictable (which leads to boredom) . I just thought it left alot to be desired.

"This movie showcases the superb acting talents of Dame Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett.  Ms. Dench is very creepy, very convincing as a chronically lonely, manipulative lesbian.  I've seen better acting from Cate Blanchett but even her worst acting is better than what you can expect from most actresses.  Bill Nighy also turns in a convincing performance as the cuckholded husband.I did not find this movie shocking in its content or disturbing, although I cannot understand how a grown woman can find a spindly, scrawny boy sexually appealing.  Ms. Dench's acting is what disturbed me.  She reminds me of a spider in a web, patiently waiting to ensnare her prey.  As a lonely, bitter spinster she successfully runs off every person she befriends with her ""intensity"".  She is obsessive, possessive, grabbing, clawing, but her prey doesn't see it coming.  If you appreciate great performances by great actresses, I highly recommend this movie.  Dame Dench's performance is one you will not soon forget.The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because I reserve five stars for movies that move me on an emotional and intellectual level, which this movie did not.  I don't believe it was supposed to.  Some movies are for entertainment purpose alone, and this is one.  Nothing wrong with that.  It will definitely entertain you.",1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2.0,-1

"I am a huge fan of the British Television series ""Mr. Bean"", created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis (who would go on to write ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and write and direct ""Love, Actually). The series, available on DVD and shown on PBS stations from time to time, follows the adventures of Mr. Bean (Atkinson), a largely silent, slightly bitter, single British man, who finds himself in various predicaments. Because the character is largely silent, he gets into a variety of situations leading to a lot of physical comedy. And he is largely reminiscent of great comedians like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.A few years ago, they made a film called simply ""Bean"", which was released in Europe before it came to the United States. A huge hit, the film was scheduled for release in later summer here in America and quickly flopped. It's easy to see why the character is such a draw in Europe; because he almost never speaks, it isn't a lot of work to translate his dialogue for foreign countries. Everyone understands physical humor. ""Bean"" was a dreadful film. The story quickly builds a pretense of getting the character to Los Angeles where he interacts with his host family and their two `adorable' kids and Burt Reynolds plays a supporting role. The film chose to replay a number of situations from the series and added two kids, who could, presumably, relate to the overgrown child in Bean. It didn't work.When I first saw the trailer for ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", the newest film featuring the Rowan Atkinson creation, I was intrigued. It seemed to be a thinly veiled re-working of the Jacques Tati classic ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" with the Bean character taking the place of Mr. Hulot. Jacques Tati's films are also significant for their sparing use of dialogue and it seemed like the translation might lead to more success.I was very nave.""Holiday"" starts promisingly. Bean (Atkinson) speeds his little Mini Cooper to a broken down church barely making the announcement of the winner of their big raffle. As it is June in England, the torrential rain is dampening everyone's sprits and Bean is especially eager to win an expense paid trip to the sunny beaches of Cannes. He wins and he has a couple of amusing moments at the beginning of the journey. After he arrives in Paris, and finds the train to Cannes, he asks a gentleman to take some video of him boarding the train. The gentleman misses the train and Bean soon realizes the man's young son has been left behind on the train. Bean realizes he has to help reunite them and they set off on a trip across France, trying to get to Cannes. Along the way, they cross paths with an American film director (Willem Dafoe) who is also on his way to the Cannes Film Festival and the young French actress (Emma de Caunes) he is courting.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" misfires on just about every count. Even the amusing situations he gets involved in on the train to Paris, at the beginning of his journey, are just that, amusing. They aren't so funny you will forever remember them forever, or so funny they redeem the film, they only manage to create a smile. The best of these is when Bean wanders into a restaurant at Gare Du Lyon, because he has some time to kill before taking the train to Cannes, he decides to eat a meal. He inadvertently orders a Platter Fruit De Mer from the Maitre' D (Jean Rochefort, ""The Man on the Train"") and is shocked to find a huge platter of oysters and large prawns, complete with eyes, delivered to his table. Atkinson is a gifted comedian with an extremely expressive face and we instantly feel his pain when he eats his first raw oyster.But this same gifted comedian can't help make other scenes more than slightly amusing. For instance, he tires to amuse the boy on the train by pasting pieces of paper on his eyelids and tongue and make them move around. This is just creepy. Later, he interrupts a screening of a film at the Cannes Film Festival in a protracted bit of unfunny business, which points to a very obvious joke.Why do these films fall so flat? It seems a shame they attempt to make these films appeals to such a broad audience. In each, Bean is paired with precocious children in a blatant attempt to both appeal to this demographic and point out the obvious comparisons between Bean's character and the children. ""Holiday"" is rated G because it contains nothing that could be considered even slightly racy or daring. But I think little kids will be bored by Bean's relatively low-key antics.One of the great things about the show is Bean was usually a little bitter about how put upon he felt. He felt entitled to certain things and when he didn't get them, he became slightly exasperated. In the films, the attempts to make him universally appealing have robbed him of this aspect of his character and simply serve to make him boring.There are two very funny moments in ""Holiday"". At one point, Bean begins to karaoke or pantomime to an aria from an opera as people walking through a French market stop to watch. Later, Willem Dafoe's American director premieres his latest film at the Cannes Film Festival and we get to see snippets of the overly pretentious piece of crap he has created and is so clearly in love with.But these moments are few and far between and it takes a long time to get there and a long time after they happen until the film finally ends. When the film does finally end, you feel a sense of relief. You no longer need to wait, hoping something, anything funny might happen. Sure, it is a wait in vain, but you never give up hope.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" isn't funny enough, amusing enough or clever enough to warrant your money or time. That's sad because Rowan Atkinson is a very funny guy and Mr. Bean has provided some hilarious moments on his television series. Rent that on DVD instead.",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",1.0,-1

"""Laura"" (1944) has a tour de force performance by Clifton Webb and a so-so undistinguished outing by Vincent Price. It's a classic movie detective story of the film noir genre with its haunting iconic theme music of the title song. Gene Tierney is the murder victim, and Dana Andrews is the detective, Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, who falls in love with the deceased. Webb plays Waldo Lydecker, a snide, nasty columnist and radio broadcaster who can make or break careers.Price is a gigolo named Shelby, a Southern smoothie, who is beloved by Ann Treadwell played by the noted actress Judith Anderson who became famous for her portrayal of Euripides's Medea.The movie in black and white holds up very well, and has a solid plot although some of the alibis get convoluted at times--especially Vincent Price's. It's Hitchcockian which is all to the good. It's based on a Vera Caspary novel.It's rather strange that Dana Andrews does all his investigating without a partner, travels in cabs, and that he lets Webb tag along while interviewing suspects. To Andrews women are dames or dolls which makes him crude in Lydecker's eyes. Laura's successful career in advertising was the result of Lydecker's sponsorship.Make sure you stay with it for the last twenty minutes because it becomes very suspenseful and is cleverly worked out. It's ell worth seeing or revisiting.",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",5.0,1

"""I would like to be your knight in shining armor,"" the vampire says, ""but I don't want to take advantage of your situation because of your emotional vulnerability."" Yes, this is a Twilight for non-tweens (its release was around the start of that Kristen Stewart saga), but without, well, without most of the things you either loved or hated about Twilight. For me, the absence of werewolves was the saving grace for this B-movie.After you watch your first 100 or so vampire films, you start to see a pattern. Namely, this genre has more than its fair share of stinkers... you almost have to grade on a curve when comparing to other genres. I can empathize with reviewers who consider 1 star too generous for this movie, but I can also empathize with a $525,000 budget in tandem with an overly-ambitious plot.Really the title is ""Immortally Yours,"" since ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is actually a Hammer film from decades ago. Immortally Yours was shot in Ohio, and about the best thing you can say about that is folks in the Buckeye State welcomed the movie with open arms, granting access to places like the Dayton Masonic Center. It's apparently a cheap state to shoot in, as described in the following New York Times piece, which discusses ""Immortally Yours"":http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/us/20vampire.htmlThe Kiwi-born actress ""Kat Hawks"" (not quite her birth name) both wrote the script and portrayed one of the central characters in Immortally Yours, and the results leave you with the impression that she's an individual who marches to the beat of her own drum. The reason Immortally Yours doesn't deserve less than 2 stars is because it does things I have never seen done in a vamp film, and I value deviation above most other qualities. She did go a little overboard tho: teleportation, astrophysics, and a dwarf thrown in for good measure (not a friend of Bilbo, I'm just talking about an actor with dwarfism).To sum up the shortcomings of this sub-million dollar production, I'll be lazy and quote something exactly true from the Film Critics United website:""Scenes went on way too long, actors seemed to be standing around waiting for their cues, the camera lingered far too long on actors doing absolutely nothing and as many plot points that were in the movie, there were more that were introduced that went absolutely nowhere.""",1429228800,"04 17, 2015",2.0,-1

"I kept on watching this movie thinking something had got to happen eventually...but nothing really ever did.It had some absolutely fabulous costumes and the backdrop was great, but I just couldn't care.  Gillian Anderson is an actress I really like, but her performance as Lilly in this movie is so ho-hum drab that she kept disappearing into her absolutely fabulous costume.  She looked great, but I just didn't get her and I didn't care enough to try past the first part of the movie.  Even the ""dangers"" she faced at having gone to a man's apartment unsupervised...GASP!...and what it led others to think about her didn't involve me in her character.I normally also enjoy the work of some of the others in this movie, but they seemed terribly miscast...or maybe the script was just that bad.  After plodding--and I do mean plodding--on through the first quarter of the movie, my attention drifted and I only half-watched the next hour or so.  After that, I honestly gave up and shut off the movie because I didn't even care enough to see it through to the end.I've seen this author's books turned into movies before, but this one has to the be the worst of the lot.

"This is the WORST adaptation I've ever seen of an Austen book ( and I have seen a lot ), but I did find myself enjoying it - for the wrong reasons. It was so ridiculous and far fetched I just had to lough, and by the end of the movie my husband and I  were laughing so hard we almost fell out of bed. And also The actor who plays Capt. Wentworth is so very hot.Persuasion is Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. It tells the story of Anne Eliott, A heroine not so young or beautiful any more. At the age of 27, Anne is considered, by that time standards, to be an old spinster  (remember, Elizabeth Bennet from ""pride and prejudice"" was 19 and her sister Lydia Eloped at the tender age of 15 !!!!). Having lost her youth and beauty and with no prospects of ever marrying , Anne is quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life taking care of her self centered father and sisters. Though They are unappreciative of her, and often mistreat her, Anne is  a strong  person  and manages to live her life with dignity and courage.  Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he was not socially and financially suitable.  Now that Wentworth is a naval officer who has returned from the war with fortune,  he's successful, wealthy and considered a very suitable match, and is sought after by every young eligible woman in sight.Anne finds herself in the dangerous situation where hopes and dreams she thought are long gone and forgotten awaken in her, but Capt. Wentworth is unforgiving and cold. As the story unfolds we discover that Wentworth's coldness is just a front to disguise the hurt he still carries from being turned down by Anne, and that he could not forget her. So much for the novel - and on to the adaptation: The script, the casting, the acting, everything was so off. Nothing made sense and nothing was there to support the narrative of the romance between Wentworth and Anne. The production's hair stylist and costume designer should have won an Oscar if there was an Oscar for  ""most unattractive and unflattering costume"" and ""The ugliest hair style in recorded history"" for their treatment of poor Anne. You can see that a lot of effort was put into turning the actress, Sally Hawkins, from an attractive young woman to a person past her prime who pays no attention to herself. But no effort is evident on the side of the script writers to provide us with even a clue as to why Wentworth would fall in love with her in the first place, and why he would love her still, after all the hurt she caused him. In the ( MUCH BETTER ) 1995 BBC adaptation of Persuasion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion-HD/dp/B00AEUPOVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion [HD</a>] we see how loyal, kind, and loving Anne is.  We see how she takes care of everyone in her family ( though they are ungrateful and unworthy of her ) how she quietly and efficiently runs her father's household, takes care of her hypochondriac and spoiled sister and does it all with a smile, and we understand why others, including Wentworth, would hold her in high esteem.But here - the writers simply cut everything out, we are left with a woman in ugly clothes and and oily hair who is also dull, uninteresting and has the personality of a door mat. It seems that she spends most of her time whimpering and pathetically crying into her diary.  Now this woman had dumped the most handsome and dashing officer in the whole wide British navy because he had no money.9 years later he shows up, still dashing but now also wealthy. She regrets dumping him, well -DUH, but why would HE even give her a second look?Smoking Wentworth stirs a lot of excitement among all the unmarried woman and  they all compete for his attention.  This is when it started to be so bad I had to laugh - on a stroll one of wenthworth's Admirers, Louisa, is flirting with Wentworth and is jumping into his arms calling ""catch me"" ,until he fails to catch her and she falls and suffers a severe head injury. This bit is indeed in the book -  but when you see how it plays out in the movie it's simply hilarious. Instead of being a tragic mishap , you watch how Louisa simply hurls herself down from a great height and you wonder if the head injury was there BEFORE she fell.Everyone is worried about Louisa and the accident accept for Wentworth: on a conversation with a friend he is surprised to find out he was courting Louisa. I should think their flirting should have tipped him off. He reveals that he  did not intend to propose to her as everyone thinks, and now he is more worried about people's expectations , rather than for her recovery. You get the notion that he  regrets she survived her idiotic accident, because if she lives he's obliged  to marry her, if he wants to or not  -  how comic.  The friend advices him to put some distance between himself and poor brain damaged Louisa, and he accepts in order to diminish any thoughts about marriage.He confesses he still loves Anne - which would be a huge shock if we did not read the novel, because up until this point he did not seem to notice her existence ( and who would blame him ).  Ciaran Hinds played Wentworth so beautifully in the previous adaptation: he gave a very nuanced and convincing performance so you can tell he still cares deeply for Anne while he is PRETENDING not to notice her. She had hurt his feelings and his pride and he is working hard to suppress his love. Here Rupert Penry Jones as Wentworth simply goes from totally ignoring her and flirting with another woman to dumping the other woman in her hour of need because he's  supposedly madly in love with Anne.  Totally unbelievable. I can't even understand how people who have not read the novel or seen the other adaptation are supposed to understand what the hell is going on. Everything is so hasty and inexplicable.The script carries on to be even more rushed and unconvincing from now on, so much of the plot and the conversations was edited out. If it hadn't been for the comic moments this movie provided, I would have turned it off by now.  It's a good thing I didn't  - because the most comical moment of all is still yet to come - the scene in which Anne is running all over Bath trying to find Wentworth. Beside the fact that running around in the streets was a behaviour  that was totally unbecoming of a lady and poor Austen would have stabbed the directors and writers had she been alive to see her heroine disgraced so, Anne is clearly in a very bad shape. By the time she finds him she is breathing heavily and panting and you half expect her to drop down dead. Despite  his confessed  undying love for her, Wentworth seems to be detached and unimpressed with her effort to find him. You would expect him to take her in his arms, or at least bring her a glass of water, but he seems mostly put off, Perhaps because she is too sweaty after her long jog . Their first kiss is weird, I guess they were going for a shy, hesitant kiss, as PDA were frowned upon back then, but again Wentworth gives the vibe like he is NOT so interested in kissing her, and that he would have preferred to wait until she showered first.",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2.0,-1

"Robin Williams continues his diverse acting ability with this role.  Unfortunately, his performance is not enough to save this movie from itself.  The film had the potential to be a blockbuster.  The problem is where it wants to go.  It doesn't know if it wants to be a psychological thriller, a Sci-Fi Fantasy or a moving Drama.  There wasn't enough to identify the characters and make us care.  With more time and added scenes, this movie could have been something.  Disappointing!",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2.0,-1
Pilot is great but following two episodes are so-so. I'd put it in the middle of the pack among modern TV sci-fi shows. Original? Only if you have just come to this planet. Cheesy in a decent but not great way.,1418860800,"12 18, 2014",3.0,0

"Warner Brothers was no slouch in the 30's when it came to musicals and this was planned to be a big one. two of Hollywood's biggest stars, with Gable on one of those costly loans from another studio (MGM) and a good bunch of Warner's contract players. The song team of Harry Warren & Al Dubin (42nd Street, Lullaby of Broadway) were brought on board. Busby Berkeley was originally planned for the choreography but he backed out and Bobby Connelly took his place. no expense was spared for sets and costumes. In fact the pre-publicity made a big deal about the studio having to raise an already huge soundstage 35 feet in able to encompass the huge dance number set. William Randolph Hearst paid for that and he seems to have had some influence on the film itsself.Marion Davies and Clark Gable had been paired before in the silly but successful Polly of the Circus (1932), in which she, a trapeze performer falls for a minister. There they had some chemistry, which is sorely lacking here. They meet oddly through the same device Fred and Ginger used in Top Hat in 1935: she's doing a late night tap dancing number in the hotel room above his and this leads to immediate mutual loathing. And why is she tap dancing? Well, she had been a waitress until she was hired as the lead of a Broadway show even though she was not a singer or dancer because the leading man had played a joke on her. Everything that happens in this film is as unconvincing and unbelievable as that and it only gets worse as the film goes on. The fact was that Marion Davies herself was neither a singer nor a dancer yet she was thrown into this role where she's supposed to be so dazzling at both that she wows Broadway.Then there is the big musical number, a two-part extravaganza of Coney Island and I'll Sing You a Thousand Love Songs, an experience you'll never forget, though not in the usual way. Coney Island is at least a comedy number where wax figures of Napoleon and the Smith Brothers come to life. The second number, which interpolates several songs including the Wedding March from Lohengrin and Shadow Waltz between its beginning and end is the very definition of static and gargantuan. With enormous all-white sets and elaborate costumes (mostly 18th century) marion is featured smiling in historic costumes while people sort of dance and move below her and on the periphery. The effect is more like a tableau than a dance number. Didn't they study Berkeley's numbers? They're all action and motion. This is where I think Hearst's influence came in. His taste was all for grandeur and effect and rather old fashioned and stuffy as well and that is what this number is like: big and grand and ostentatious and boring as all get out. And it overwhelms poor Marion.The film is still interesting, even as a misfire. Walter Catlett is fun as the Broadway producer and Roscoe Karns is his usual acerbic self though after a while a bit too much. You do get a rare chance to see a slim Pert Kelton as the temperamental lead actress who quits the show, looking so far from the role she is most remembered for as Mrs. Paroo in The Music Man.
