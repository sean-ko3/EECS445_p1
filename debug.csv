"We found Wild to be very disjointed & really quite boring. We were happily we had not doesn't time & $$ st a theatre.. If it was intended to ""copy"" THE WAY, it was a very poor job. Too bad, Reese Witherspoon is a great actress, but the story was definitely a ""stream of consciousness"". Would not recommend this to anyone. Waste of time.",1429228800,"04 17, 2015",1.0,-1

"It is one of the better world war 2 movies made. Mostly because since it is a series, it can take the time to explain in more depth than a traditional hour and half show. That said, it is not without its faults. The horror of battle is shown I believe often more for viewer effect than drama. Again a matter of my likes and opinion. I do find that not having well established actors is a major benefit. The actors do a great job in their roles. Of course the gentlemen who open each show with their first hand statements is as it should be. All in all, a first rate series I can recommend to friend.",1410480000,"09 12, 2014",4.0,1

"Wow... talk about bad acting. I realize I'm reviewing a zombie movie, but would it kill the producers to find a mediocre actor at least? The guy who played Brian was awful. The guy who played Daniel was okay, but most of the movie centered on Brian. Honestly, at times, I was really hoping Brian would get killed off.On top of all this, the first 20 minutes or so had almost no dialogue. Again, I realize it's a zombie movie, but some dialogue is better than none, especially when the first 20 minutes are flat-out boring.The only reasons I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the setting was different and the special effects for a low-budget film were pretty good. Still, I can't recommend this. It was really bad.",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2.0,-1

I thought I was going to love this movie.  I know it has crude humor I was prepared but not for this.  It was too over the top for me and I didn't enjoy it.  There were a couple of parts that you will laugh at regardless of liking it or not but it just fell flat it was the same jokes that they have used before and I enjoy many of these actors/actresses but it was a huge disappointment from beginning to end.  Would not would not even give it a start of you could rate something ZERO!!!

"A lot of low rating reviews are too picky. They pick out a single thing in the movie and say the whole movie is bad. I was surprised by a well rounded fantasy story mixed in with Chinese folk-tale. You simply can not compare it to the Chinese movies. Those tend to be darker with complex relationship and usually the fighting and killing are ruthless with body parts getting ripped apart. Maybe that is why reviewers are saying this is more family friendly. Overall, the story was well thought out. The kung fu fighting scenes were intense and top quality. All actors did very well in portraying their characters. I never watched it because I heard bad reviews from critics when the movie came out. Finally saw it. And I was thoroughly entertained. In terms of showing it to kids, there are still some spots of violence that are not for kids. I probably would limit this movie for kids at least 14 years old. One more thing. The bonus features are fantastic. I have the single disc version and it has quite a long list of bonus features. Make sure you watch all the bonus features!",1262044800,"12 29, 2009",5.0,1

"Back in the giddy Nineties I would have thought this was an artsy production but here at the end of the less impressionable Tens I found this to be an unpleasant movie, which means it succeeded in what it was supposed to be. Effectively conveying the miseries of a stressfully repetitive job, this film plodded through an hour and a half of mostly complaints and nagging and conveyed how awful working in a trendy little restaurant can be. While two of the staff at this unnamed Soho cafe slogged through in mature fashion, Neve Campbell's endlessly rude and self-pitying ""birthday gal"" character really wore me out fast. Never before on film have sweaty kitchen personnel and bored, job-loathing wait staff been portrayed like this, which doesn't always make for a nice viewing experience. If you need to, see I Really Hate My Job for the bizarre and oft-Googled nude scene, because frankly there isn't a lot else to give you a bang for your buck. If you do manage to sit through ninety minutes of would-be artists, actresses and writers wishing they were almost anyplace but where they are, well, you've earned the right to look at Julia Salinger's past-prime hangers.Four stars for good performances, two stars for plot, about negative five stars for enjoyability.",1261526400,"12 23, 2009",3.0,0

The corn field is inside the city, for crying out loud.  How scary can that be?At least the fourth movie was a bit of an improvement.  I would strongly recommend looking into the first two Children of the Corn movies before spending money on this low budget film.

"Kill Bill, Volume 1 started was filled with a lot of energy, and Quentin Tarantino, seeing how it was his movie, definitely left his 'better' marks on it.  However, I could not fully get into the movie.  I know that Kill Bill is a homage to old Asian fighting movies, and spaghetti westerns, and in that light the movie flows, but from an average viewer standpoint who probably has not seen too many of those, it just is a lot of fighting with a lot, and a lot, of fake overdone bloody scenes.  Now, if you like Quentin then you will probably like this movie, because it is done in a very creative, yet still Quentin style.  I guess, the movie overall is okay, especially since they had the time to put in a creative anime sequence, but I still did not think too highly of the movie overall.",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",3.0,0

"This is not a perfect film, but it's bold in its technique and approach and the performances are stellar across the entire cast. All 7 of them.

"There's almost nothing witty or romantic about this film that tries so desperately to be both it makes you sweat watching it.  Yelchin has no sex appeal whatsoever, and his becoming the lover of a beautiful older French woman is as implausible as his being a writer who claims to have 100s of rejections--but you only see dozens on his walls (which somehow are soft enough for thumb tacks).  Glenn Close and Frank Langella are wasted in minor roles which are borderline anti-Semitic, and the whole thing feels like a fairy tale, predictable and thin.  The lead actress doesn't have much to work with because the script is so weak and the movie so vapid it feels as if it's a remake of a French original.....",1453075200,"01 18, 2016",2.0,-1

"""Murder by Numbers"" is based on the real life Leopold-Loeb case of the 1920's and the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock movie ""Rope' although it doesn't credit either. The plot involves 2 upper class and intelligent students planning and executing the perfect murder on a random victim for the thrill and the challenge. In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock. She is good as the detective in pursuit of the twisted murderers but she has very little to work with here as far as the script, the cliched characters and the weak plot twists. She's a good actress but not a magician and this would fall into her lesser movies and possibly her least.",1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2.0,-1

"IMPORTANT NOTE June 28,2013: For anyone on a budget or who only wants to purchase certain seasons of Dobie, SHOUT! is also selling all 4 Seasons of The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis separately. You can pre-order Season 1 now, as it will be released on September 10,2013. This is great of SHOUT! to also release the Seasons separately, as I have a few friends who are only interested in the early Seasons when Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld starred.The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a television series based on the collection of short stories of the same name by Max Shulman. The series revolved around typical 50's teenager Dobie Gillis, played by Dwayne Hickman, who wanted what every teenager dreams of having- popularity, money and beautiful girls. Dobie's best friend is not your typical 50's teenager, but the new teenage beatnik- Maynard G. Krebs played by Bob Denver. Dobie has to contend with his classmates- some are what he himself wants to be- such as the popular and wealthy Milton Armitage played by Warren Beatty or the spoiled rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr. played by Steven Franken. The prettiest girl in class is someone Dobie would adore to have as more than just his love interest- Thalia Menninger played by Tuesday Weld. The only thing keeping Thalia out of Dobie's grasp is his lack of money, which Thalia loves and has to have. Dobie's best female friend is brainy classmate Zelda Gilroy, who keeps him in reality with her keen observations on their teenage life. Dobie's parents who own a grocery store add a lot of comedy to his 50's life, as does best beatnik friend Maynard.The guest stars were always just as interesting as the cast. The wealthy mothers to Milton Armitage and Chatsworth Osborne Jr. were the same actress- Doris Packer. Since Milton and Chatsworth were cousins, their mothers were obviously sisters. William Schallert played Leander Pomfritt, the English teacher in both High School and Junior College. Jean Byron played mathematics teacher in both High School and Junior College also, and it is funny that Schallert and Byron ended up playing Patty Duke's parents following Dobie Gillis on The Patty Duke Show. Dobie's real life brother, Darryl Hickman played his brother Davey Gillis and Michael J. Pollard played Maynard's cousin Jerome Krebs. Raymond Bailey played the Dean, who many of you will recognize as Milbourne Drysdale from The Beverly Hillbillies. There was also quite a list of girl's Dobie would like to date on the series- Yvonne Craig (Batgirl), Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible, Space 1999),  Marlo Thomas, Sally Kellerman, Ellen Burstyn (when her name was McRae), Michele Lee, Cheryl Holdridge and many more.CBS aired the show from 1959 to 1963. Even though it was a big hit with the late 50's and early 60's teenagers, it never went too high in the Nielsen ratings. In Seasons 1 and 4 it never made the top 30, and in Seasons 2 and 3 it made #22 and #23. The first season focuses on Dobie in High School, the second season finds Dobie and Maynard joining the Army right out of High School, the third season finds Dobie and Maynard in Junior College, and you can tell from the last and fourth season that the writers were running out of ideas to keep the show going. In the last season, they actually wrote a show about being stuck together with one of those straw Chinese finger locks called The Beast With 20 Fingers. When the show began, you would always see Dobie posed as Rodin's The Thinker contemplating his newest teenage dilemma. The times may have changed, but Dobie's teenage dreams of popularity, money and beautiful girls has not.This is a wonderful, witty, funny and sharply written show that Dobie fans have been begging to be put on dvd for many long years. It's hard to believe that Shout! Factory is making all of our wishes come true on July 2, 2013, after such a long wait! The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a launch pad for many very young actors and actresses careers- Warren Beatty, Tuesday Weld, Michael J. Pollard, Yvonne Craig, Jack Albertson, Sally Kellerman and Michele Lee to name a few. A Million Thank You's Go to Shout! Factory for all their time and effort working on the Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis. I heard we will not only be getting all 4 seasons pristinely fixed up on dvd, but some fantastic bonus material as well! From All Of Us Dobie Fans- THANK YOU SHOUT! You've made our long awaited dreams come true!!The Main Cast:Dobie Gillis........................................Dwayne HickmanHerbert T.

"I can always count on Clint Eastwood to make a good movie. Mystic River is just the right amount of drama-- obviously it has some disturbing ideas, but not sick and twisted ones you would see in horror movies (IMO). I mean the movie shows how characters cope with the trauma and troubles that they are faced with. I saw this movie when it came out and again just recently. It is one of my must own movies because it has such a great mysterious plot which kept me guessing. All of the actors including Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon gave great performances. The music suits the movie well. The only thing I found annoying was when Dave (Tim Robbins) kept talking about the forest and the wolf...Alot of people seem to complain about the ending. I think it was sufficient and well made. The idea is to make do with what has happened since you can't take back what has been said or done. etc..This movie gives you something to think about and has a satisfying plot, 5 stars .",1288224000,"10 28, 2010",5.0,1

"Dark Ride (Craig Singer, 2006)When your big draw is that one of your cast members is Ashley Tisdale's sister, you're probably in big trouble. That said, Jennifer, Ashley's older sister, is marginally less annoying, and the movie, while derivative and schlocky, is not thoroughly unwatchable.The very thin plot: In 1989, a serial killer was discovered operating in a dark ride (what the rest of the world calls a tunnel of terror) in an amusement park in Asbury Park, NJ, and put in an institution. He breaks out fifteen years later and heads back to his old hunting grounds. On the same night, a group of kids on their way to spring break decide to spend the night in the same dark ride, which is scheduled to reopen three days hence.The movie suffers from two plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The first I can't say anything about without revealing some major spoilers, but the second I've already mentioned; how is it that no one figured out that an escaped serial killer would go back to the place where he'd committed his crimes? You'd think there would be a few uniformed people around over and above the security guards. (This would have actually worked in the film's favor, I think, as it would have increased the risk factor for the group of teens breaking into the place to spend the night there.) If things like that will kill your enjoyment of a movie, then you might as well stop reading now; they're there, and they're awful. Now, the many other things that might also kill your enjoyment of this movie. There's the acting, which ranges from mediocre (lead actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler of The Sopranos, whose role consists of either screaming or sleepwalking through her part) to the truly horrific (Alpha Dog's Alex Solowitz, who plays the group's driver, a stoner surfer-dude type; on the plus side, Solowitz is the spitting image of a young Ron Perelman). The special effects are, to put it tactfully, not special. The plot is tissue-paper thin, as it is with most slasher films, but there's not even an inkling of interesting ways to break out of the mold here; this is a straight slasher film of the type that hasn't been fresh since about the first Halloween film. About the only positive thing I can say is that at least, as with the horrible House of Wax remake from a few years ago, both the crew and the ""name"" star were smart enough to keep the most fun murder for said ""name"" star. (It almost takes the cheesiness out of the obligatory bra-flash shot Tisdale has at the beginning of the movie.)But, despite all this, as long as you turn your brain off, it's not something you'll find yourself actively hating. That doesn't come until afterwards, when you're wondering why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life on it. **",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2.0,-1

"Like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O'Connor's funny man part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends.Whereas ""Singin' in the Rain' is a classic American movie musical, 'Cover Girl' is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn't very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after.Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's during the last years of her life.Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain'.The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2.0,-1

"The 1993 version of Nicholas Nickleby should not be considered.  It is not merely the snake-faced appearance of the actor who plays the lead, nor the fact that he speaks as though he has a bad cold with a stuffed-up nose.  But he is also a contemporary character, not a nineteenth-century character.  And that's just for starters.The 2002 version is not bad.  With widescreen and surround sound and good photography, this is a good production for what appears to be a limited budget.  Problems begin with the casting.  The American actor who plays the lead speaks in a carefully articulated generic English accent, but that won't do, nor the fact that his manner and mannerisms are those of a contemporary rather than a period character.  Christopher Plummer is an accomplished actor, but his effort here seems half-hearted, as though he didn't think much of this production.  The actor who plays Smike mumbles his lines as though he is bucking for the role of Hamlet.  The story is powerful enough that this movie is not a washout, but none of it is particularly well done.What the above versions lack is comedy.  Dickens was fond of mixing hilarious comedy with the most heart-rending drama, and Nicholas Nickleby is no exception.  The above versions are merely drama.  But the biggest crime is in the character of Mrs. Nickleby.  Mrs. Nickleby is one of the great comic characters of world literature.  Unfortunately, she is also politically incorrect.  The above versions simply throw out her character and replace it with a blah nonentity.The 1977 version.  At over 5 hours, this version brings in more of the minor characters of this long story and treats the story according to the book.  As often with the BBC, there is lavish attention to sets and their accuracy and little attention to anything else.  The music is nonexistent.  The photography is not bad indoors but the few outdoor scenes are overexposed.  And the acting is marginal at best.  Nigel Havers is much too old for the role of Nicholas but does an adequate job.  The ending is satisfying.  All in all, well worth seeing, especially for readers of the book.  The emphasis is on drama.  There is humor in the character of Mrs. Nickleby and an attempt at humor in a couple of the minor characters.The 1947 version was made before the Dhimmist ideology came to dominate movie-making, and here we find Mrs. Nickleby in all her mind-boggling glory.  In fact, all of the characters in this movie have that Dickensian edge that makes them larger, or at least more effective, than life.  Good scripting and good direction make for a hard-hitting, heart-touching and occasionally side-splitting experience.  The actors and actresses don't TRY to speak in an upper-middle-class British accent; they simply speak and behave as they normally would and it is true to the period.  The pace is fast, and the script had to streamline some of the events, but all of the major events are here and are effectively presented.  The ending is far more dramatic than in the other versions.",1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2.0,-1

"The lone survivor of the Erotic Witch Project creates havoc while undergoing psychiatric treatment at a top-secret medical facility. THIS IS A COMEDY! Director John Bacchus has broken the boredom of sex-laden direct-to-video erotic filmmaking, churning out movie after movie at breakneck pace (hard for even me to keep up with) with an incredible end product each time. EROTIC WITCH 2 is his best yet, being the funniest and sexiest of anything he's done so far. All the acting is great, the direction & editing are way better than usual for this format...and then there's Darian Caine. While she's the only returning actress from the first movie, she steals the show every time with her uninhibited & energetic performance. She's just so damn funny, and not afraid to be non-sexual if the moment is right. Truly a great talent, I would probably watch anything as long as she was in it. Darian brings even more fire to an already hot picture. Way more NUDITY & SEX than in the original. There are at least 5 or 6 girl/girl sex scenes with full nudity, all softcore (of course). The 3-way at the end of the first one is topped here by a 5-way featuring all the female actresses that appear in the film. Unlike the first movie, the plot of this one doesn't even try to imitate the plot of BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS. I guess no one really saw it so they didn't figure anyone would care. Plus, they were limited to shooting on video. Ah, what am I complaining about? This movie rules! And like the other Bacchus DVDs, this one features a 30-minute ""making of"" featurette and a ton of trailers for other Seduction Cinema releases. Can you beat that? Put this one on at your next party and see who becomes an instant fan! EROTIC WITCH 1, MISTRESS FRANKENSTEIN, and EROTIC SURVIVOR are also highly recommended.",991872000,"06 7, 2001",5.0,1

"I cannot possibly express my love for this movie.  It is so good.  One of the best post-apocalyptic/vampire movies I have ever seen, and I love that genre, and have seen hundreds of movies of this type.  The story is awesome, and in some ways actually believable.  You need to suspend disbelief a little bit, but that is true of most movies, whether they deal with supernatural subjects or not.But the best thing about this movie is the creepy factor.  It's also extremely scary, and I love to be scared, as do most people who enjoy horror movies.  The director and actors do I really good job of drawing you into the action, and making the audience feel as though they are right there in the middle of it.  Truly some of the scariest sequences that have ever been filmed.If you enjoy horror/sci-fi/action adventure type movies, you will enjoy this one immensely.

"We got this DVD as a hand-me-down from my child's older cousin. I really didn't expect a Barney movie to be at all watchable, but it is. My 2 year old absolutely loves this, so I've seen it repeatedly and don't suffer. It is a cute story with a decent children's plotline and is visually appealing. The young actors are good and quite likeable. It's not as enjoyable as any of the recent Disney or Pixar productions (which have a lot of comic turns for adults as well), but for small children it has everything; a touch of magic, adventure, comedy, warmth, and lively musical numbers. Adults won't love it, but your little ones will! Another asset that's important to me is that there are no real scary moments. My 2 year old is not ready for scares, and that's why he doesn't watch *my* favorite kid's movies yet (toy story, monsters inc, etc.), and he won't be able to enjoy those for a couple of years at least. This movie is exactly what I look for for him right now.",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",5.0,1

"This is a really, really terrible version of Bronte's classic book. It is absolutely sodden in film-making cliches, shot in a completely unimaginative way, poorly adapted, poorly cast, poorly acted, and extremely poorly directed. The adaption makes a mockery of the fantastic language of the book by making it into a really overly dramatic cliche, with all the obvious things and extremes used. The casting is terrible - Fiennes does his best but is far too Shakespearian for Heathcliff, while Binoche, though a good actress, is a terrible choice for Cathy - with her French accent shining through, and her cute, totally un-wild nature. Also, the transition from children to adults in the film is a real jump and is totally unrealistic - they look about 35 when they are meant to be 15. I watched this with 10 other people who had all read the book and we all just laughed all the way through, because it is such a terrible film and so utterly cliched in the delivery of the lines, in the use of special effects, and so forth. This really is bad - avoid.",1071273600,"12 13, 2003",1.0,-1

"I found myself wondering if this film were based on a video game.  Lame acting--main character seems to be on drugs.  More action than character development.  Unrealistic reactions from some characters.  For this type of movie, didn't like the flashback style of the beginning.  No need to see the first few minutes again.However, most of the movie was better than I expected.  This movie received terrible reviews and was only in theaters where I live for a very short time.  Didn't expect much, so wasn't disappointed.Except with the ending.  Very abrupt and left me going HUH??  Pretty obvious what would eventually happen, but interesting that the creators avoided explicit violence at the very end, unlike throughout the earlier film.  I think they were hoping the film would be a hit so they could justify a sequel that would pick up at this point.  Probably not, unless it goes straight to video.",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2.0,-1

As far as the 8 films to die for series goes this one rates among the better ones.  It has it's story and sticks to it. The acting is actually very good and the story kept me interested.  The movie does get a wee bit on the cheesy side towards the end and I fee like there was some missed potential with this concept but it was definitely well worth the watch. My biggest complaint is how stupid the monsters look.  I really feel like they could have done a whole bunch more with them if they had taken to time. But if my only complaint is that the monsters are stupid then I think the movie did a pretty good job especially for a low budget film.

After I watched it, I looked at the DVD cover to see why I ever bought it (49 wasted) and it said on the cover that it was a comedy. Always up for a good comedy. I didn't know it was supposed to be funny. I am going to watch it again with new understanding, I hope. I had NO IDEA this was a funny movie. I should have read the cover before I watched it; I could have anticipated the clever nuances of humor so cleverly disguised as boring stupid garbage. Other people should be warned. This movie literally makes The Grass is Greener appear humorous in comparison.",1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2.0,-1

"Given the great success, both artistic and and financial, of Legally Blonde perhaps it was inevitable there be a sequel. What wasn't inevitable was that it be this bad.To start with, Elle Woods' IQ has dropped about 30 points between films. Maybe 40. Her characterization consists primarily of doing and saying things so godawfully stupid we cringe. In the first movie, though Elle was portrayed as sort of super-Valley Girl, and a bit obsessional on the topics of clothes and hair care products, still there was a first-rate brain under all that curly blonde hair. Where is the smart, self-possessed, articulate Elle from the end of the first movie? I ask, because she's nowhere to be seen in Legally Blonde 2. Reese Witherspoon is a fine actress who should have known enough to flee in terror from this script.Another problem with Legally Blond 2: the plot is built around obvious absurdities. Elle decides she needs to find her dog Bruiser's mother so she can invite Mrs. Bruiser to her upcoming wedding. Jesus wept. Let's pause for a moment to recognize that in the first movie, even though Elle loved her pet as much as many pet owners do, she never descended into blithering idiocy about it. Elle hires a private detective to locate the mother of this homeless stray she found on the street years ago....and the detective does it! No explanation of how, it's just a fait accompli. All I could think was, ""You have GOT to be kidding me."" In the first movie, its great attraction was that it took place basically in the real world, with a logical cause-and-effect system in place. It's just that Elle was the destabilizing factor that pushed things over the edge into comedy. In Legally Blonde 2 there's no logical cause-and-effect; things happen just because the plot requires them.Elle, using the detective's information, tracks Mrs. Bruiser to an animal testing facility. Thereafter we're treated to a dissertation on what a horrible, horrible thing this is. Okay, the morality of animal testing is something we could debate, pro and con. There's a place for that, but it's not in a movie like this. If you want to preach, get a soapbox. We're paying our eight dollars and fifty cents on a Reese Witherspoon Legally Blonde movie to be amused and entertained, not to watch the world's longest PETA commercial.",1127088000,"09 19, 2005",1.0,-1

"I'm no stranger to bad action movies or horrible Independent film efforts. I'm reminded of Michael Dudikoff's wooden acting in the early American Ninja movies, and other would-be action stars in similar low-budget travesties. So, regardless of the pain, I make it a policy to always sit through the entire movie before writing a review. It honors the time and energy of every human that was involved with bringing the production to fruition, and once in a while, I am surprised as things turn around. This is not one of those times. After a promising opening sequence, this film suffers.As far as silver linings, the martial arts master - Mark Mikita - certainly has some moves. However, I don't think they were showcased very well with this production style, and he needs a lot more experience/coaching to develop a film presence and escape a robotic delivery of his lines. Conversely, Vivica Fox and Tom Sizemore do have acting skills. That helped. But both were ill-served with poor writing, limited sets, flat dialogue and a supporting cadre of ""raw"" actors and actresses, i.e., the goons. The editing style also seemed to omit brief parts of the story transitions, but it might just be that they were never filmed. Bai Ling, as the bodyguard, is a bit of a wild card. I've never seen this actress, though she clearly has other credits. Admittedly, she had a pleasant impact with her eyes and body language, but otherwise was pulled down by the surroundings. One last prop to Chris Jai Alex who played Sizemore's lead henchman... he did it well under the circumstances.Parental Advisory: No nudity or sex, but if this was a drinking game every time the word F**K was used, I'd be dead. You also have modest blood with a few of the fight scenes.Rating: Part of me wishes I hadn't stumbled upon this one, and I debated writing a review at all. However, what's done is done. I'm sure some folks will disagree, but on my Indie scale, this is barely a 2 out of 5. Yes, I've seen that many films over the years that were worse. Go into this one with very low expectations.",1432166400,"05 21, 2015",2.0,-1

"Fasten your seat belts!  When I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was a David DeCoteau production. One of his gay but not really gay movies. Let's get to it. I don't care that every one of these are filmed in the same place (I morbidly watched some of the previews) after all this is super low budget stuff. The ""acting""....horrifying. The ""story""...was there one? I get the impression that the idea is to titillate gay men with there admittedly handsome and very nicely built young men (whose acting abilities are so stiff you could dive off them) spending 10 minutes each doing push ups, showering and rubbing himself (3 different guys). There is the terrible ""love interest' too, some chunky no talent blonde girl. Now the big question...why does this guy put some aging bad actress in just about every one of his movies (trailers again) this one is Darcy DeMoss????? for Friday the 13th part 6....REALLY???!!! does anyone remember her? does anyone care???

"I first heard about Juno when I read about its popularity at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival. The story, upon first read, about a smart-ass teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with the challenge of how to handle it, did not impress me. It wasn't a storyline that captivated my imagination or my intellectual curiosity. So I wondered. Why did this film keep receiving adulation from just about every movie reviewer under the sun? Rotten Tomatoes had a multitude of positive reviews with a few negatives ones sprinkled in. I decided I wasn't going to fall for the media circus surrounding this picture and would wait for it to come out on DVD.Now I have written screenplays before so I believe I can be quite critical from a screenwriter's standpoint given that I know what is involved when crafting a screenplay. Let's first review the movie:Juno tells the story of a 16 year old girl, sarcastic, smart and a bit too cocky for her own good as she finds out right at the start of the film that she is pregnant after having casual sex with her highschool boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker. Once Juno finds that she's pregnant, she informs her best girlfriend and they discuss what exactly she should do. Juno then breaks the news to her parents. Her parents give her the OK for an abortion ( a tad too cavalier in my opinion). Juno attempts the abortion route but gets cold feet. She then decides to give her baby up for adoption. She places an ad in the local paper and identifies a lovely wealthy couple who want to adopt. Will things go smoothly for Juno? How will she respond once she gives birth?For starters, this basic plot outline doesn't do much for me. I'm not intrigued by it and my curiosity has not been peaked. If I read the logline of this script it would not be one of my first reads. But let's begin to analyze this picture.Now I realize that each and every family on this planet is different. Parents are not the same all over when it comes to their emotional reactions. Juno's parents know very well the sharp-tongued verbal antics of their daughter (mother shown is actually step-mother to Juno) so one would take that into consideration. However, the reaction by both parents to Juno's admission of pregnancy is so calculated and without serious emotion that it begs the question, what kinds of parents are these people and would they actually exist in real life or are they just a caricature created by screenwriter Diablo Cody? One has to seriously ask this question because once Juno decides to initially opt for abortion wouldn't she at least bring one of her parents to go with her? Juno ends up visiting the abortion clinic alone! What kind of parent would send their teenager alone to an abortion clinic to get an abortion? It begs all credulity! I bring this up because it strikes at the very premise of Diablo Cody's smartly penned dialogue. These characters are indeed fictitious with not a shred of relevance to an actual family faced with the challenge of raising a ""know it all"" teenager.Once Juno enters the abortion clinic, the director tries to show how uncomfortable Juno is inside it by focusing on strange sounds the various people are making inside, (i.e. such as nail filing). The woman at the abortion clinic front desk appears to incongruous to say the least. No abortion clinic I've ever heard about or visited would ever feature such a character at the front desk. Again, this character was created by Diablo as a way to entertain the audience but at the same time ""creep"" Juno out from actually having an abortion.Let's discuss Juno's boyfriend, played by Michael Cera. The on-screen chemistry between Michael and Ellen Page (who plays Juno) is good but nothing to write home about. This is mainly due to the meekness of Michael Cera's character. They are such opposites that again, it strains credulity to think that a sarcastic ""know it all"" like Juno would be attracted to such an introvert like Michael Cera's character. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but Michael's character is bland, boring and dull.The two parents who consider adopting Juno's child, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are played well and I don't have any real criticism for either character. Both actors perform well and the twist that Diablo Cody includes in their relationship provides for the drama that occurs later.I've come to the conclusion that the reason why this film gained such popularity is two: People were delightfully stunned by the crisp, back and forth repartee between characters (courtesy of Diablo Cody's sharply penned dialogue); the overall fine acting by all of the cast; and finally, audiences like movies where everything is taken into account and there are no serious questions left to ponder. Juno nicely wraps up by the end of the film and you're left with nothing more to ruminate on. At least I didn't.But as a screenwriter, I'm here to tell you that in cinema, if you want respect from a screenwriter, you've got to inject some plausibility into your screenplay! (Unless you're writing an action/adventure film like Rambo or a superhero film like Iron Man)Juno, as a drama/comedy, has no plausibility. Audiences who saw this film were simply looking to be entertained and they did not approach this film with the background of a screenwriter. But great dialogue does NOT MAKETH a GREAT MOVIE. Great dialogue ELEVATES a good story. But I can't say that Juno is even a good story. I'm not sure what is ""good"" about it especially when it treats one of the most polarizing topics in the United States (abortion) with such triteness!I've read interviews with Diablo Cody about how she came to write Juno, and what I found most interesting is that she focused more on the dialogue of her story than anything else. And in many ways, she had to! The story in and of itself, as it is presented on screen, is boring. It does not stimulate and it does not provoke. If the dialogue had fallen flat in this picture, Juno would not even have ranked a blip at the Toronto film festival. Now Juno COULD have been more stimulating a picture, if the issue of abortion had been delved upon much more in depth. But then that would have changed the point of the story. By avoiding the issue of abortion, Diablo make this film much more palatable to the movie going audience. She's no dummy!In conclusion, if you are looking for light entertainment, then go see Juno. The dialogue is what makes this film. Yes, Ellen Page does a masterful job of capturing the character of Juno. I actually hope to see her star some day in better films than Juno as she is obviously a capable actress. Time will tell. What I took from this picture was that audiences like films where everything is resolved by the end of the story and the lead character rides off into the sunset. Audiences enjoy seeing films that don't provoke and merely entertain. Audiences want to forget about ""reality"" and see a film that describes another world far removed from the one they are living in.",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",3.0,0

"The first two Mummy flicks were both obvious labors of love by Stephen Sommers, their writer/director. They were amazing showcases for CGI effects, but beyond that they had engaging stories full of pulp action, lots of comedy that did not descend into camp, and wonderful characters performed by perfectly cast actors. Brendan Fraser, as American soldier-of-fortune Rick O'Connell, was a perfect pulp hero, brash and cocky and capable. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn ""Evy"" O'Connell (n Carnahan) was the brilliant and (extraordinarily) sexy librarian who could hold her own in a scrap. Together they had incredible chemistry, crack comic timing, and the charm and natural repartee of a classic  Hollywood couple (like Gable and Lombard, or Powell and Loy).Throw in John Hannah as Evy's sleazy but lovable brother, Arnold Vosloo as great villain Imhotep (whose ultimate fate, at the end of the second film, possesses pathos and tragedy), and a host of great supporting roles, and you have some flicks with great characters on the screen at all times. Even the kid who plays the O'Connell's son, Alex, in the second film is brash and bratty without being annoying, a rare thing in a character like his.The O'Connell's adventures continued in a short-lived cartoon that was fairly good, and I remember it fondly as one of the few sources of pulp goodness I could share with my then five-year-old son.He and I watched The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor last night. When I say it's incredible, well, you'd darn well better believe that I am lying. Flat out full of it. On a George W. Bush scale. Because it's terrible.Here's what's good about it:  * The idea to do a third Mummy film.  * The idea to use China as the setting, to do something different with the mummy idea this time around.  * The idea to cast Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (always a great idea to cast either, an exceptional idea to have `em both).  * Some cool creatures, like a really nicely done dragon, but especially the yeti. Because the yeti are the one point of absolute true awesome in the whole flick.  * The final battle is okay.You may notice that three of the things that are good about the movie start with ""The idea to..."" But those things ended without bringing the ideas to enjoyable fruition. The way it turned out, it was actually a bad idea to do a third Mummy film, the idea to use China was fine but the resulting story wasn't that interesting (though a good script doctor could have done great things with it), and they got Li and Yeoh in the film, and gave them both very little to do that was at all interesting.This movie isn't a labor of love for Stephen Sommers, who this time just produced. It possesses none of the warmth or wit or charm of the previous films. The action is dull. The characters are uninteresting, and the main characters are written inconsistently with their earlier portrayals.This is a bad movie. But beyond that, it's a bad movie with a worst thing about it. No, it's a bad movie with a Worst Thing About It. And that worst thing is Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz (who read the script and smartly refused to do it) as Evy.This Worst Thing About It is two sided. First, it's bad because we lose Weisz, who was always magnetic and funny and smart and strong and just smoking hot as this character, and who had wondrous chemistry with Brendan Fraser.Second, it's bad because we wind up with Bello, who is a very talented actress, but plays Evy with all the spunk and sexiness of a wad of mashed potatoes, and who has absolutely no chemistry with Fraser.I can't overstate how badly this miscasting damages the film. The relationship between Rick and Evy is the heart of these movies, and had Weisz returned, this film would be at least twice as watchable just because of the dynamic between her and Fraser. Bello's performance is a sinkhole that draws the attention and drains away even what little vim there is in this movie. Even my son, who normally wouldn't be caught dead saying he cared about which actress plays a girl character, started kvetching almost immediately, and early in the film started cheering on the villains whenever they had Evy in deadly peril. He genuinely liked Rachel Weisz, and her replacement by Bello was so awful it was like a personal offense to him (and to me, and likely to a vast majority of fans of the previous films).This film pretty much murders the franchise. This Mummy stays dead, and it should never have been born.",1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2.0,-1

His film making may have been unique when Kill Bill was released but it's lost it's impact.  It's not new now...just a long and boring film that I couldn't wait for to end.  Nothing happened in this movie-I think he's lost it-,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",1.0,-1

"I'm all for real life and realistic stories but this was a depressing film without a satisfactory resolution. I am not referring to a happy ending, but more in the sense of a satisfactory ending that covers all things brought up in the story.",1430092800,"04 27, 2015",2.0,-1

Not everyone can play a hero and this may be an example of how important that is -- Frankie tried but it was hard to separate  the man from the role.,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",3.0,0
