"As a kid I really loved this movie. As much as I was interested in Baseball, I was interested in the idea of travel, and the idea of Japan. The plot and production value are atrociously bad, but I guess back then it was acceptable. I still love the idea of the Bad News Bears, but the closer I look at it now, its like a bad accident that you can't look away from. 'Merica.",1448064000,"11 21, 2015"
"Really nice plotline of the written words of a man and a woman from eras ago and the two people who trace their intertwining history.  Ms Paltrow is excellent, as usual.",1356048000,"12 21, 2012"
It's a cute movie and the kids enjoy it.  It just seemed a bit rushed and shallow to me.,1483401600,"01 3, 2017"
"Home Theatre is becoming more common each day and buying the right DVD for your system is most important. The movie is the main ingredient/bottom line to all this equipment! Being a videophile I am obsessed in getting the best quality picture and sound available! So my reviews will concentrate on the total DVD package.TOTAL RECALL is my (#2nd) Home Theatre DVD Review. This is the movie's second release and the first was fair but they got it right on this ""Special Limited Edition"".Now this DVD is Digitally ReMastered (Picture & Sound). It is enhanced for Widescreen (16:9 Aspect Ratio) TV's & HDTV's. The movies picture is one of the best (sharpest clarity) I've ever seen on home DVD. NOTE: 480p = 480 horizontal lines (Digital) of Progressive Scan (p) - which is basically a line doubler and using COMPONENT VIDEO cable for the best picture quality. Regular DVD players have 480i = 480 horizontal lines (Analog) and use either COMPOSITE or S-VIDEO Cables. For more information see my SD-6200 & MV3CV-2M reviews.Simply put this is a scifi Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie of the highest quality (special effects, story line, casting & color). He is caught between a boring life and the strange desire to be an action hero on Mars. He sees a TV ad referring to a brain implant journey to Mars. This is the latest Travel scheme fad of the time. A mental exercise in time and space. (pretty clever huh?) The name of the company is ""Rekall"". This is just the beginning of a great DVD journey!!!! (Parental Guidance required - some graphic violence and mutant make-up).The colors are absolutely beautiful, so vivid. The Sound is so crystal clear. (5.1)Extras are abundant and delightful including a Commentary Track with Schwarzeneggers many fond memories. This DVD is a great value and total eye & ear candy!!!!",1001548800,"09 27, 2001"

"It's easy to find things to hate about any country or culture; it's especially easy to find things to hate about the USA. The fact that so many Americans are ""in on the joke,"" and laugh about the absurdity of their own civilization concerns me. This isn't the first movie to raise awareness on a rather serious issue, while at the same time being flippant about its own message. Idiocracy comes to mind. And although God Bless is funny, at times, I feel guilty for finding it so. Here is a movie that highlights and ridicules the most shallow aspects of entertainment in the country, and rather than leave it at that, it devolves into some awful parody of itself by investing in massive amounts of violence. Maybe the director is trying to pander to his audience, who even though they believe themselves to be above the vile figures portrayed, are nothing more than consumers of the very filth railed against in the film. This is hypocrisy at its finest, in other words, and everyone is in on it. Me too, and I hate myself because of that. Having seen the previews before, I started watching the film with some knowledge of the plot. I wanted to sit and watch the mutilation and destruction of things that I see as repugnant. Unfortunately, I became repugnant for indulging in that desire. I haven't felt this dirty watching a flick since Borat.Structurally, God Bless is very well-made. Even if the ending is predictable, you get that feeling as with all good road-trip movies -- you're just along for the ride, no matter the destination. The acting is superb. The only other program I've seen Joel Murray in is Mad Men. He was a decent choice for the disillusioned Frank. And the fantastic Tara Lynne Barr, his sidekick, reminds me of a young Christina Ricci.Be wary of a film that preaches one thing and practices another. Maybe I took its theme a little too seriously. I doubt it. There is something perverse here.",1440979200,"08 31, 2015"

"Total Recall is...meh. There's some good action to see and some fun to be had but there's also some pretty bad dialogue and a weak plot to get through. Farrell and Biel do pretty well with what they're given, but Cranston is extremely underutilized and I'm not sure how I feel about Kate Beckinsale's Terminator-esque attitude. The movie went through a lot of production woes so hopefully there's a more satisfying Director's Cut to be seen in the future.",1350432000,"10 17, 2012"

"This movie is about time--time that moves forward for some people, backward for others. But for those who watch this movie, time won't move at all. You will feel as if you are trapped forever in an ever-changing, but somehow, never-changing time warp of pseudo-profound revelations, full of sound bites and fury, signifying nothing--because nothing is what this movie is all about. Really. Absolutely nothing. Not even Brad Pitt imitating Tom Hanks imitating a Georgia cretin could save this film. And that's saying a lot.Now that I mention it, Queenie's ""You never know what's comin' at ya"" sounds an awful lot like ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get."" And ""Some people are artists, some people dance, etc."" sounds just like ""There's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been."" Could it be that Benjamin Button actually IS Forrest Gump moving forward in time? Or, even more thrilling, could it be that Tom Hanks is Brad Pitt moving backward in time? Does this mean that Brad Pitt will eventually end up on an island, talking to a volley ball? Or, most tantalizing of all, could it be that someday Hollywood writers will go far enough back in time that they will finally come up with an original idea?My recommendation is this: Don't waste 2 hours and 45 minutes of your precious forward-moving time. You will only be one hundred and sixty-five minutes older, and will have gained no greater insight into the true nature of life, love, and dancing. Instead, go get a copy of The Confessions of Max Tivoli (the book) and read it. It's another take on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald that inspired this film, but, unlike this dreadfully tedious movie, it is not a waste of your time.",1253404800,"09 20, 2009"

"You will never see a worse movie, especially Highlander, than this steaming pile of fresh horse manure.You are hearing this from someone who was an intense fan of the original movie, the television series, the third film and even gave Endgame (the fourth film) a chance. I hated that as well, but -NOTHING- and I mean NOTHING compares to how bad this is. This awful, wretched, steaming pile of waste makes even Endgame look like a viable film.I cannot believe, for a second, that the actors agreed to this and let themselves be humiliated in this farce of a film. The director and producers should be strung up for this, if not worse. I cannot believe they are thinking of doing this as a trilogy and I hope, sincerely hope, that it doesn't ever go further. Highlander needs to be allowed to die off, because it seems the movies are getting worse and worse.Please, please please do not buy this. Do not encourage them to produce more of this garbage and destroy the Highlander mythology and characters even further. What else can I say? If you like Highlander, do NOT buy this movie, because it will ruin it for you. It is beyond bad, it is beyond awful, it is something altogether wretched and vile. You will cry at how bad this movie is, so spare yourself the misery.Shame on you Adrian Paul and everyone else involved, especially the producers, for making this awful, awful movie.",1199836800,"01 9, 2008"

"Whether you know it or not, you've seen The Task before.  Granted it was in the form of plenty of other unoriginal slashers, but you've seen it before, and seen it done way better as well.  A group of college kids all get to participate in a reality game show that takes place in a huge, creepy, run-down prison; with each having to accomplish various tasks that correalate with their own worst fears...or something.  Such things as story, plot, character development, and any sort of logic are all tossed out the window.  None of this would be that bad were it not for the fact that the first hour or so of The Task is so slow and boring and it takes forever to get anything going.  Still, once it gets going, it provides some decent shocks and offers a nice enough denouement, but other than that, there isn't anything else about The Task to recommend in the least.",1311811200,"07 28, 2011"

"We watched this after learning that Amazon was charging $9.99 to watch the updated version of Sherlock Holmes 2: Game of Shadows with RDjr. This movie is less entertining but I think at the time it was made it was probably good. This movie has its moments and purportedly portrays the real Holmes in several vignettes. Apparently, this version is heavily edited and several scenes in the original are missing.It is not a bad movie. Filming and music score are nice. Directed by Billy Wilder. Nice movie for a rainy afternoon. The movie warns of mature themes but I think this is a bit of overkill. If you are extremely conservative concerning any sexual matters than -yes- it might be offensive. Mostly the subjects are only mildly sexual and very dated in the humor.",1388793600,"01 4, 2014"

"Augh!  This has to be one of the first movies in a long time that both Mr. Ireland and I ejected from the DVD player.  It goes nowhere.  At all.  The slow build up at the start and the first induced car crash held both of us.  But the lengthly second set up was too dull.  The forced '70's feel of filming interrupted by cellphones, etc burned thin quickly.  The DVD player spat it out while the 2nd set of chicks were debating test-driving stuntman style the white Dodge Challenger.",1304208000,"05 1, 2011"

"I love Black And White Films,especially those with Meaning but..when I saw this movie after hearing/reading great acclaim(with the exception of Woody Allen a strange sicklittle man.)Bergman apparently had some daddy issues and that in turn influenced him in Matters of Faith sadly(I don't blame him his dad was a so-called ""Minister"" that's protestantTalk for unqualified and no tradition.)You can tell his Bias stretches into his ""work"" and while the movie has it's merits(the Man is a Crusader back from the Crusade,but sadly is questioning everything and God.)The movie fails for me it might appeal to the so-called intellectual crowd i.e., those who question God and God's Existence and read Castroite Sarte's work(who later on had to admit The failure of the so-called Revolution),The movie is drawn-out long and not even the beautiful camera work and scenes can save it and what is with the Jesus on The cross. It was as although some intentionally made Jesus to look bad on the cross..just a beard.. Add to the movie Chess and you have a egghead's revolution. Watching the movie was an experience I will not forget and will not repeat,given it's NeoPagan/New age(dancing at the end with death and Making the Dark Ages Dark just to fulfill historical myths.)",1323302400,"12 8, 2011"
"I love Liam Neeson's acting and usually the movies he starts in.  This one is so bad and I surprised that he decided to take the role.  It started out to be promising but quickly turned grisly and just plain annoying.  The unrealistic looking wolves who kept tearing people apart were pathetic and the bloody remains of people gruesome to see.  I won't go into more detail about the movie in case you like long, boring movies and want to try suffering through this one.",1379635200,"09 20, 2013"
"Ghost Rig is about a group of environmentalists who decide to bunk down on an old abandoned oil rig to try to prevent it being sunk into the ocean. Soon after the group arrived they start dying one by one, and like in most survival horrors it soon becomes a race to escape. The gimmick of this film is that there is a evil Spirit on the rig and it go from host to host killing the former host as it leaves, this created paranoia and distrust among the characters as they never know who the Spirit is in.You will not really see anything you have not seen before with Ghost Rig, it is a survival horror and that is pretty much it. However the rather nice location of an oil rig, something which is not used in to many movies, and a few twist and turns change things up enough for the movie to be interesting. Now if you are looking for blood and gore you will not be satisfied with Ghost Rig, the evil entity do rack up a body count after a while but there is not much gore, however the film do have a nice atmosphere and while I would not call it scary it is entertaining.As with all low budget horror movies my expectations for this movie was rather low, I was however positively surprised by Ghost Rig. It is not a great film in any stretch of the word but it is rather ok. I think there was some sections of the film which where to drawn out, and at times the film could get a bit confusing, but all in all I think that Ghost Ship is pretty good.If you are looking for a bit different but still following the typical script survival horror then you might want to give this film a try, especially if you can find it used or cheap, Ghost Rig had some problems and it is obvious that it did not have the biggest budget in the world but it kept me entertained for the one and a half hours it lasted and I consider it a good buy.",1296950400,"02 6, 2011"

"Highlander is a great fantasy-action film although the sequels have been widely mocked (only Highlander: Director's Cut and Highlander 2 are included). This 2-disc release does not include Highlander 3, 4 (Endgame), 5 (The Source) or the TV show. I'm not sure what happened to this franchise because only the original is worth owning. All five films bombed at the box office (that must have set some kind of record) although The Source only got a limited run in some countries and aired on TV in the US. Highlander 2 had the highest budget and the highest domestic gross in the franchise although many fans consider it the worst (some feel The Source is worse).Overall, the picture quality is average at best (Highlander 2 is particularly poor) but the audio isn't bad. Some of the bonus features for both movies have been ported over from previous releases (Highlander gets a paltry 6 minutes and an audio commentary). There is a total of roughly 2 hours of supplements which is light for an anniversary collection. The original theatrical release of Highlander 2 isn't included. The original Highlander is a 5 star film but this is a 2 star package. It is fairly pricey at $65 for only two films since they can both be purchased separately for $26 total.Special Features:Highlander: * Deleted Scenes, * Audio Commentary with Director Russell MulcahyHighlander 2: * ""Highlander 2:: Seduced by Argentina"" Documentaries, * ""The Redemption of Highlander 2:"", * ""The Music of Highlander 2:"", * ""The Fabric of Highlander 2:"", * ""Shadow & Darkness: The Cinematography of Highlander 2:"", * Original Cannes Film Festival Promotional Reel, * Deleted Scenes, * Original Theatrical Trailer",1378857600,"09 11, 2013"

"It's hard to have sympathy for characters when you actually want them to die. And that's how I felt about the Green brothers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Brian (Chris Pine), especially Brian. When you're one of the few people left alive after a major plague then driving stupidly all over the road is not what I'd do for fun. Nor stopping off at a golf resort to hit a few rounds.Along with the Greens are their girlfriends Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp)Some reviewers have talked of the 'rules' the Green brothers come up with. They're great rules, however they're undermined by the fact that they don't follow them. They pick up Frank Holloway (Christopher Meloni) and his very sick daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka). Rule #1 broken. Sure they seal off with plastic the back of their car, but later when Jodie starts a coughing fit Bobby, instead of going around to the back of the car to give the girl oxygen lunges through the plastic knocking off her face mask so that the little girl coughs blood straight into her mouth. Rules #2-#5 broken there - and a glimpse of the problem with the film. All the 'drama' is caused by forcing situations to arise.All of the drama is similarly convoluted.",1310256000,"07 10, 2011"

"This is a decent set,half I loved..and the other half I thought was so-so. Still a good buy-The Outing (1987): full screen, picture looks like a high quality VHS, no extrasIt's about a evil genie that gets unleashed and causes rampage. It start off slow but picks up and doesn't stop. My favorite of the set.-The Vagrant (1992): widescreen,has great picture, no extrasIt's about a man moving into a new home but there's a bum that starts to make his life a living hell.The movie is fun and there's never a dull moment..I enjoyed it a lot.-What's the Matter with Helen (1971): widescreen, has great picture, no extrasIt's about two women who sons go to prison for  murder, the women start to get death threats. So they move to California toget away from all that. But still this person keeps calling and one of the woman starts to see a man outside of their place.The movie is a slow burner with a small kill count, I found it not really my cup of tea.-The Godsend (1980): widescreen, has good picture, no extrasIt's about a family who comes across a lost pregnant women so they take her in. She then has the baby at their house thenjust vanishes. So they take care of the baby as their own..while it gets older it kills...it's a demon child.The movie again is a slow burner but it's okay..I wouldn't watch it again.",1382745600,"10 26, 2013"
"Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, a spiritual leader who's tired of being ""the poor man's Deepak Chopra"". He's hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs because they think the only way they can win the cup is if their star player gets back with his wife and they hope Guru Pitka can get them back together.From Mike Myers, creator of Wayne's World and Austin Powers, I'd expect a solid comedy, but ""The Love Guru"" was obviously not written on one of his good days (Myers and cowriter Graham Gordy ""won"" a Razzie Award for worst screenplay). The story is weak but in comedies like this the characters and jokes are often more important than the story. Unfortnately, Guru Pitka is nowhere near as funny as Austin Powers for instance, and the jokes often fall flat, with some exceptions. Ben Kingsley's talents are wasted in an unfunny role as an older guru. 1+",1283731200,"09 6, 2010"

"This film is mesmerizing.  The creature designs are incredible - even down to the flora and fauna!  And the film's music score is gorgeous.However, I simply was not moved or affected by the film at all.  I don't  think the story is its strong point.  There are prophecies, saving the  world, and magic.  But it's almost as if the script is some textbook  example of what elements to incorporate in order to call a film a  ""fantasy"".  I never felt connected to the main characters, the  Gelflings. So I never care what happens to them at the end.And my final  complaint are the ""bad guys"" - the Skekses (or however you spell  it!).  I found them simply annoying.  They are the most Muppet-like and  least successful as creatures.I was very excited to see this film again  - it'd been a while since I'd experienced it.  It was a bit of a let down.  However, there is no denying that Henson & company tred new ground with  THE DARK CRYSTAL.  The work is simply amazing.  I just had a few qualms  with the story.The DVD, by the way, is an excellent presentation.  And  the bonus cut scenes are interesting.  There is also an isolated music  score.

"A bit contrived and often flat in the scenes between Hitch and Alma (what Hitch himself would have done with placid English domesticity curdled with perverse impulses!). But Tony Hopkins' Hitchcock is a nice piece of impersonation. And Scarlett Johansson's Janet Leigh is crisp, a sharp little miniature of tone and likeness. Some specific complaints: the first act seems rushed. Some histories have ""Psycho"" coming as a result of Hitchcock's shrewd reading of the emerging market for cheap, dark little exploitation/drive-in movies. ""Hitchcock"" instead casts the movie as a make-or-break moment for Hitchcock's commercial viabilitywhich it may have been, but those beats are thinly established. Instead the movie pursues a melodramatic subplot in which Hitchcock suspects Alma is cheating on him. He's tormented by his suspicions and his fears, which are voiced by Ed Gein himself as a kind of spectral conscience. A bizarre and distracting choice (maybe Bosley Crowther would have made more sense). Getting any movie made is enough of a tale of farce and treachery; why the creative team added this layer of misdirection is hard to figure. For my own taste, it would have been much more illuminating to have the film plumb Hitch's creative and commercial response to the ""Psycho""-like cheapies that were crowding out his own brand of filmmaking. The point is that ""Psycho"" was a turning point for Hitch; his sexual obsessions became starker and less playful after ""Psycho."" The film is more like a shrieky coda to ""Vertigo"" than this film lets on. This movie depicts him stumbling and unsure of himself during the filming of what is rightly considered a masterpiece. There's some dramatic value to that, but it  doesn't account for the masterly confidence of virtually every shot in ""Psycho."" If Hitch was an artist on the downslope of his powers, where did such a movie come from, given he was working with a rookie screenwriter and the production crew from his TV series? What I missed most in the movie was some of Hitchcock's own wit in teasing out the perversity of quiet middle-class people who dabble in murder firsthand or once-removed.",1463961600,"05 23, 2016"

"The only things which stops me from rating this 5 stars are (warning minor spoilers below):Once the story gets past these rough spots, the movie gets way more awesome...The introduction of Chow Yun Fat's Character: Ken and the old trope of ""never before mentioned twin brother"".1). The scene where Ken forces the protection racket mobster to eat the rice from his restaurant felt forced and unnatural and it really didn't fit well with the pacing and the rest of the movie. Chow Yun Fat did a great job with the crappy dialogue he was given for his character and he was the only one truly acting in that scene - but even if the other actors stepped up to their parts... it was still bad writing and pacing.2). Twin brother. - It would have been better if Chow Yun Fat played the same character from the first movie and to provide an explanation of how that character survived: (like maybe he had a metal plate in his skull and the bullet slid around the plate and exited through the skin at the front of his head and he was in a coma)... bringing back the icon to the sequel was a brilliant move because it brought back his fans, but it could have been handled a bit better.The rest of the movie was intense and overall it was highly enjoyable. I would give this 4.5 stars but half stars aren't supported.",1362614400,"03 7, 2013"

"""Deep Rising"" is a kind of action/horror film that you watch on midnight TV. You may not be particularly impressed with the impossible story, but you keep watching because anyway it keeps entertaining in its own way. It is not the greatest horror film in the movie history, but is not the worst either. Director is Stephen Sommers, the guy responsible for much better ""The Mummy.""Treat Williams is an adventurer hired by the group of the pirates led by Wes Studi. Their target is a luxury ocean liner which is just attacked by a man-eating creature(s?) with huge tentacles. It is a typical B-movie premise (though the effects are superb), but it is fun nonetheless. Listen to Treat William's character repeatedly say with a self-mocking tone ""Now what?"" and we all know that we are not supposed to take the film seriously.""Deep Rising"" understands the rules of monster flicks: they need beautiful ladies and some occasional comic touch if possible. Famke Janssen is the beauty and Kevin J. O'Connor provides laughs. The film also includes the supports like Djimon Hounsou, Jason Flemyng and Cliff Curtis, but don't expect character development or something like that. You just don't have one - the good is always good while the bad is always bad - and all that is intentional.I have seen the film in theater about 10 years ago. Then I was not impressed very much (though not disappointed either). Since then I have seen it several times and I started to like it more.

"I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.",1104278400,"12 29, 2004"

"It looked like it was filmed in a day with a jumbo bag of stale Fritos, Cheetoes, and two liters of safeway brand Mountain Dew with no fizz at the catering table for food.  I've seen yukky extremely low budget movies before but this one takes the cake.  I had to shut it off after 10-15 mins, as it was so boring and stupid.  The only reason someone gave it more than 1 star was probably due to Holly in a towel or something.  If you want soft core, then watch soft core.  However, if you want a seriously good slasher/gore film, watch *****""Simon Says""******.  Its a new cult classic that has sexy eye candy on top of sexy eye candy for both sides, and is one of the best chop 'n guts movies to ever come out in the last 10 years.  Simon Says is a very high budget, theater quality movie that is currently being shown here on Prime.  What Simon does to that rolled ""fatty"" that as big as a huge salami and how he puts it to the stoner dude is classic and will go down in history as extremely epic.  Watch it just for that, but also watch it because its so good.Now, DONT watch Intrusion.  Its seriously cheap looking and sounding with one of the lowest budgets ever for a movie.

Its not quite as gripping as the first film, and it has less satirical bite. It also has a somewhat muddled plot and a hastily wrapped up cliffhanger ending. But as with the first film the cast are excellent, the effects are quite impressive, and its an entertaining enough romp, even if its not quite as profound as it likes to think it is. 3.5/5",1482278400,"12 21, 2016"

"This is one of those films you find yourself laughing at--not because it's got good humor in it, but because of all the things it does wrong. The script is corny, the acting poor, and the story line trite and uninvolving. They don't even show any extended figure skating scenes, which would have at least added a nice note as that is always fun to watch.The dialogue between the two leads is supposed to be snappy, but with the wooden way they deliver it, it's just dopey (I'm surprised these two actors ever worked again after this film came out...) The two skaters bicker non-stop through the whole movie and then are supposed to fall in love at the end, though I didn't buy it for a minute. They are both unlikeable, as characters and as actors, so I didn't care what happened to them in the end...unless they would have fallen through the ice, which would have ended this dull ice skating  movie on the proper note.",1182038400,"06 17, 2007"

"No one who has stated that this film feels like a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the wonderful J.K. Rowling novel, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is wrong.  They are 100% correct.  With that said, however, I must admit that I still enjoyed this film.  For fans of the books (like myself), this film could be very brutal at times, eliminating the bulk of the tale in order to swiftly move to the primary story.  In essence, this film paid lipservice to most of the parts of the book that didn't deal directly with Harry.As a film, this movie is enjoyable.  It moves at a very swift pace and never gets too boring.  The action scenes are well done and the acting is, as a whole, very good.  The music was also very good, although it isn't too hard to emote ""dark and gloomy"" when it's all over a film.  The special effects were, as expected, brilliant.  It was nice to see the Dursleys back on the screen, no matter how brief their moment was.It's nowhere near five-star quality, but it does progress the film series along fairly well.  I have a few gripes that I believe need to be addressed.  Firstly, the film seems to be lacking heart, which was central to all of the previous films.  As highly developed as these characters were through the other movies, this one seemed to detach the viewer from the players on the screen.  Another problem is that key moments that were included were often treated lightly or in a careless fashion.  There are also a few editing choices that give the film a disjointed feel.  My biggest gripe was the treatment of some of the new characters like Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and Bellatrix Lestrange.  These are three of the most imaginative characters that Rowling put on paper and of them only Luna gets decent screentime.  Tonks, played by the lovely Natalia Tena, pops up, says a few lines, winks at Harry, and then makes a few funny faces before being brushed by the wayside.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfectly cast as the wicked Bellatrix, but she snarls at the camera, does the ""deed"" she's expected to do in the film, and the sings her way off into the sunset.  I completely understand that the director and screenwriter were trying to compound a very big book into a reasonable running time, but I felt as if they just tossed a coin to decide what stayed and what had to go.Could the movie have been better, yes, but it's still not as bad as a lot of films out there.  Like I stated before, a lot of the story was cut from the book to give this film a reasonable time limit.  I just feel as if the parts that were excluded were done so rather carelessly.  Compared to the other Potter films, it's a three star movie.  Compared to other fantasy flicks that have come out lately, it's three-and-a-half stars.If you're a Potter fan, buy it and enjoy it for what it does have in it.  Otherwise I'd just keep it as a rental.",1198108800,"12 20, 2007"
"OK. I know everyone loved Amour. I'd put off watching it until last week because I didn't want to see Jean Louis Trintignant at 82 rather than his lovely 36 years in A Man and A Woman. I streamed Amour via Amazon and then had to rewatch the Man&Woman race scenes to clear my head.  All that aside, I have to say I hated Amour for reasons far more important than the loss of physical beauty. It was boring. Interminable. I mean, this is a story about an intelligent woman, a strong woman, a determined woman. And yet, what does she do when, at the advanced age of 82 she has a stroke and begins the long final slide into incontinence and incompetence? She just slides. Did she think she would never die? Or that she would be hit by a bus and that would be that? It appears she did not think at all. And once she has the first warning stroke, does she order in a bottle of Seconal and fifth of gin? No. She does nothing but show some irritation at her increasing limitations.  And meanwhile, the ancient husband Jean Louis is rushing around preparing meals and changing her nappies and protecting her from all outside their closely held world. Claustrophobia anyone? This thing grinds on for over 2 hours. I've read many who say it was beautiful. What was beautiful about it?  My suggestions for a remake: 1. Cut it to 90 minutes. 2. Give the first hour over to a celebration of their life together, show fabulous music, and parties, and friends. Show joy and devotion. 3. With 30 minutes to go, she has the stroke. Goes to the hospital. Learns the procedure for repair failed. Knows she's on her way out. 4. Finally, for the last ten minutes, we see her still able to mix a drink (the above mentioned combo)and she wheels herself into the grand living room full of friends. Her pupils play the piano for her. She sips her cocktail and, smiling, closes her eyes. No one notices she's gone but the camera.",1377648000,"08 28, 2013"

"May Britt, whose greatest claim to fame may have been her marriage to Sammy Davis, Jr., plays Ingrid, a deeply religious woman.  Someone molested Ingrid as a child.  A series of attacks by a scissors-wielding person seems to be making Ingrid relive the molestation in her mind.  Ingrid is also in fear of someone raping her.  While the scissors-wielding person is one of the people she fears, it seems she is worried about most men, except her uncle.  I will discuss Ingrid's Uncle a bit more in a moment.We do see a murder by the scissor-wielding maniac at the beginning of the movie that sets the tone for Ingrid's fears.Frankie, who works at the local meat market, attacks Ingrid twice.  One of the things that bothered me was that Frankie's attacks on Ingrid seemed different to me from the attacks on other people.  Then there was the stranger in town.  Strangers are always easy to blame for attacks.  However, in most modern thrillers the designated stranger is usually there to provide distraction from the real killer.The one person in this movie, besides Ingrid, who is strange is Ingrid's uncle.  He seems to appear and disappear with regularity.  While I had Ingrid's uncle pegged as a possible attacker, when Frankie attacks Ingrid I got confused.  Fortunately, Uncle Carl, played by veteran actor Cameron Mitchell, provides some answers in the final scene of the movie, so things do get a bit more clear at the end.Though this movie focuses too much on Ingrid's flashbacks and Ingrid's concerns about a possible attack until something actually happens, as the movie nears the end things heat up dramatically.  A shower scene near the end of this movie gave me flashbacks of the shower scene in the Alfred Hitchcock's version of ""Psycho.""  Things happen quite quickly in the last fifteen minutes of the movie and a lot is crammed in, so you have to watch closely to understand, or at least, be prepared to understand, what is happening.  Even watching closely I was a little confused until the very end.  Some surreal moments near the end added to my confusion.  The surreal moments were likely deliberate to keep the end as much of a surprise as possible.While this movie is not one of those you put on your ""must watch"" or ""must have"" list, it is worth a watch for the surprise ending.  Some viewers may guess certain aspects of the ending, but guessing and seeing are two different things.  I was moderately surprised at part of the ending and I did enjoy watching this movie, but I doubt I will watch this movie again.Picture Quality:  Mostly acceptable, but some of the scenes were too dark.

"""Instead of the end mabye we just found the beginning.""  A series of short movies that involve people looking for meaning in thier lives.  This is a movie filled with symbolism, most of it I am not smart enough to fully get.  Like ""Guilty Hearts"" this is a series of movies that have the same idea but are not connected.  Unlike ""Guilty Hearts"" this one is easy to watch.  There is really not much to review here as it is not a typical movie.  If you are into art-house like independent movies this is a great one to watch.  The cast and acting is great, the movie is OK, if you like this kind of thing.

There is NO Thrill or Suspense in the stories, or even any urgency on the part of the Team to solve these crimes. They are so relaxed and nonchalant about their job, like they are solving a cross-word puzzle, not murders. The characters are also 2 dimensional, so it's impossible to get to know them or to care about who done the crimes and why.

This is a fun episode, though I'm pretty sure it's available on another DVD.""Merry Christmas, Little Bill!""""Little Bill"" no longer airs on Nick Jr. in the U.S. and doesn't air on Noggin, so any episodes they give us on DVD are golden. In this episode, twice the length of a normal two-story ""Little Bill"" episode, the Glover Family is celebrating Christmas. No Kwanzaa for them, Christmas. Little Bill is excited about a visit from Alice the Great, but disappointed when her flight home from a visit to a cousin in Cincinnati (is it just me or do cousins / uncles / aunts, etc. on TV shows always come from somewhere in my home state of Ohio?) is delayed. Will he find a way to bring her home?""The Snow Fort""I adore ""The Backyardigans,"" but once again, this is available elsewhere. Still, it's pretty cool. In this one, Pablo and Tyrone are Mounties protecting a fort, while Uniqua and Tasha are the Ski Patrol.""Catrina's First Snow / The Snow Festival""Ah, Oswald. A delightful show that used to air on both Nick Jr. and Noggin, but is no longer on either in the U.S. Fred Savage's voice for Oswald reminds me of the late John Ritter's for Clifford the Big Red Dog. In these two relaxing, comfortable stories, Oswald first takes baby Catrina out for fun in the snow and then organizes fun activities for a snow festival after a freak snowstorm changes plans for a fall festival.This DVD also includes ""Dora the Explorer"" --- ""To the South Pole"" and ""Max and Ruby"" --- ""Max's Christmas / Ruby's Snow Queen / Max's Rocket Run.""

"I'm a fan of the 1999 ""The Mummy"" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Mummy Returns"" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. ""Returns"" put an end to that.",1160784000,"10 14, 2006"

"I love these double feature packages. Two movies for the price of one. And it's an sepecially good deal  when both  the movies are absolutely first rate, such as with the ""Devil's Advocate""/ ""Insomnia"" pairing. This is about the best Double Feature DVD I've reviewed. Both star Al Pacino. In the first, he's the CEO of a major NYC law firm, sorta. Well, Pacino was excellent, but the whole movie came out very strange and rather other than expected, much to my delight. Strangely enough, it was one of the better movies I've viewed in years. I gave it five stars.In the second movie, Pacino was a Los Angeles homicide detective on loan in Alaska and working on a complicated murder investigation where Robin Williams was the chief suspect. Not only was the case complicated, but the mind of Pacino was severely impaired by insomnia associated with the 24-hour-days of the Alaskan summer. The acting was excellent. the filming and direction was first rate. The story  was a bit lacking. I rated the film as four stars, but a strong four stars.You can't get a much better double  feature packet than this one, and if you're an Al Pacino fan, it's just all the better.Gary Peterson",1363046400,"03 12, 2013"

"Everything awful and wonderful about Arnold Schwarzenegger is in Commando(1985). Macho, virile men dominated the action movies of the time.Schwarzenegger was cast as John Matrix, a commando who must rescue his daughter Jenny from a Latin American dictator in Val Verde.The fictitious Latin American country Val Varde was also featured in Die Hard 2(1990). The film mixes ultra-violent action with laugh out loud humor. There's references to The Terminator(1984) such as ""I'll be back, Bennett!"" Rae Dawn Chong is really good as Cindy, an airline stewardess who helps Matrix save his daughter. Some people love the over the top baddie Bennett. The ABC TV version of Commando was heavily recut to tone down the violence. The late Bill Paxton appears in the film. The late James Horner composed some good music for the film. Your ears will hear a lot of steel drums! A Russian guy made his own Commando remake in 2008. There was a short lived toy line based on the movie Commando. A John Matrix action figure would be neat. This movie has no relation to the 8 bit Nintendo game Commando. Commando is a guilty pleasure starring ""The Governator"".",1523145600,"04 8, 2018"

"TROIS, the second feature by Rob Hardy, director of CHOCOLATE CITY is an erotic thriller with few thrills and even less eroticism.  What it does offer is a plot that defies logic and a cold lead male character.  The women are a little bit better and are definitely nice to look at.  Adorned in neglige that looks like it is at least a size too small, Kenya looks like she is about to burst at the seams.  But alas, the filmmakers shy away from nudity and sex barely rises to the level of a daytime soap opera.  This is really a shame because Black sexuality is so rarely presented on screen.As a big supporter of independent film, specifically Black independent film, I can forgive murky lighting and mediocre sound.  I'll even overlook minor plot inconsistencies and weak acting, but I find little to endorse here.  The story makes absolutely no sense with seemingly arbitrary twists and turns.  It also includes a preposterous sub-plot involving a child custody battle.The only real highlight of the movie is Gretchen Palmer.  She seems to be the only one of the major cast members that understands how to play her role for maximum camp appeal. If only Gary Dourdan's character weren't so dour and Kenya took her role less seriously, this might have still made for a fun movie even with it's many flaws.  The somewhat similar UNINVITED GUEST, while also quite flawed is a better bet.  This film is also devoid of any real nudity, but it tried at least to give its sex scenes some sense of danger and excitement.  If you can't wait for UNINVITED GUEST to be released on video and are just starving to see Black sexuality on the screen, I'd say first look for a copy of SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT or perhaps, CITY OF HOPE.  In the latter film (which is a serious drama), Angela Bassett and Joe Morton have a nice go at it in one scene.  If you've just got to see Kenya Moore, your money would be better spent by buying her calendar or getting a copy of SENSELESS.  In the meantime, we'll just have to wait for Kenya to get a role that does her justice.",975024000,"11 24, 2000"
"This story had so much potential as an inspirational movie, but wallowed too long in depression leaving little room in Heaven.  I started to think this movie was a vehicle for the shameful, gratuitous advertising of a notorious unhealthy fast food chain.  There was too much emphasis on the negative to be fully inspirational.  More than anything else, the acting was flat and the script poorly written.  What Don Piper was faced with is no doubt painful, miraculous and inspiring, yet the ""movie"" falls short of fully grasping the glorious and delivers more on the depressing... would you like fries and a milkshake with that?",1450396800,"12 18, 2015"
"I was profoundly disappointed by the new Robotech movie.  I eagerly anticipated this release for more than 2 years, and when it finally came out, it was an enormous letdown.  The problems with this production begin with the story.  The first act is nothing but a rehash of the last two episodes, and certain events have been rewritten.  There are only five characters from the original saga present, including Rick Hunter, Louie Nichols, Scott Bernard, Ariel, and the Regis. And let's face it, Louie Nichols and the Regis frankly aren't very interesting. Marlene appears as a hologram, Claudia Grant is referred to briefly, and the Sterlings are obliquely referred to.  Part of what I wanted to see in a sequel to Robotech was what happened to all the characters I loved, especially people like Rick, Lisa, Max, Miriya, Rand, and Rook.  I'm not interested in generic characters like Marcus Rush, Vince Grant, General Reinhardt, or Maia Sterling (Where's Dana?  Where's Aurora?).  And when Rick Hunter does appear, he looks nothing like the guy I remembered from Macross.  He looks really old, and he has a big scar on his face.  I don't think he spent that much time fighting the invid in the SDF-3, and I don't buy the theory that fighting the invid made him turn into a decrepit old geezer. The reality though is far more mundane. This wasn't done for creative reasons.  Harmony Gold only did this because they aren't allowed to use the original Macross character designs due to the longstanding rights issue. If that's the case why even bother making this movie?! I think it's fair to say most fans want a continuation of the Macross segment, not just a half baked sequel to the Southern Cross and Mospeada segments.In fact, the SDF-3 is hardly even in the movie.  I thought that was the point of the sequel, to find out what happened to the SDF-3 and to show what is going on aboard that ship.  The writers didn't do that.  The story presumes that the viewer has knowledge of the events of the Sentinels, in which the humans met the Haydonites.  There is really no drama at all with the appearance of the Haydonites, and the revelations that occur later in the story with regard to them come across as just a plot device.  It wasn't shocking at all.The dialogue is painfully bad.  I cringed watching all the scenes between Marcus Rush and Maia Sterling.  ""Nice skull,"" Marcus tells her in a crowded elevator, complimenting the skull squadron logo on her flight suit.  Could you get any lamer than that?  Is this Ford Riley guy a real screenwriter?  And why is there so much technobabble during all the bridge scenes with Louie Nichols?  I thought I was watching Robotech, not a bad episode of Star Trek TNG.  In typical Star Trek fashion, like the second coming of Wesley Crusher, Louie quickly figures out some obscure technical solution that miraculously saves the day.  He also has a habit of taking everything Vince says literally, which makes Vince angry, and Louie says sorry.  It wasn't funny the first time, so what makes you think it will be funny the second, third, or fourth time?The animation is also not up to scratch.  While Macross and Robotech are two different franchises, they come from the same genre, so they invite comparison.  The hand drawn (and computer) animation in Macross Plus, made more than 10 years ago, is superior to anything in Shadow Chronicles.  Macross Zero, released four years ago, has vastly superior computer animated mecha battles.  Robotech's mecha designs are simply not realistic enough.  They aren't even better than some amateur CG fanart one can look at these days.  And the animation for the battles was also poor.  Why are all the missile contrails just straight lines of light?  The screen is filled with nothing but straight lines going after the enemies.  More realism or dramatic license would have been preferrable.I really hated the musical score. The opening title quotes the main Robotech theme for only a few phrases.  The rest of the score sounds like a score to a Star Trek episode, and by that, I mean: not the Ron Jones Star Trek. More like the Dennis McCarthy Star Trek. There are no really distinctive themes to latch onto.  It's meant to be epic, it avoids the cheesiness of the original 80's score, and it has the atmospheric sound and mood, but it is completely bland, generic, and derivative.  Years ago, the composer himself sent me an angry email criticizing my comments telling me I should keep my opinions to myself.  I just found it astonishing that any serious film music composer would deign to respond to an amazon review.  In response, I noted that I only comment on the music because I am an avid film score fan.  Does one need to be a writer in order to criticize a book, or a filmmaker in order to comment on a film?  Is a degree in music composition a pre-requisite to express an opinion on the film score?  Some film composers seem to think they are somehow exempt from criticism since they don't consider regular fans knowledgeable enough so we should ""keep your opinions to yourself.""Does the movie do anything right?  Not really.  It does sort of resolve the relationship between Scott and Ariel but that's about it.  It resolves nothing else that we wanted to find out at the end of Robotech.  It has good animation compared to... 1985, but it is vastly inferior to the standards of contemporary animation.  Overall I have to say it is a huge disappointment.  Robotech the TV series was great, I thought.  This movie is lousy.  I watched it once and sold it on the secondary market after one viewing.  There is apparently a sequel in production, but why bother?  I just feel after watching this that Robotech is dead. Harmony Gold does not have the talent nor the vision to continue the Robotech storyline in a satisfactory manner; all they know how to do is keep re-releasing their Robotech DVDs to milk their cash cow. They talked about trying to make Shadow Rising, or do some prequel Robotech Academy. Here's what needs to happen in order for this series to continue in a viable manner.  Resolve the longstanding rights issue. Clean house and fire everybody who was involved with this Shadow Chronicles project's creative team, from the top starting with the executive producers all the way down to the individual animators. Get new blood, new vision, new everything. Of course that will never happen because 1) that would cost a lot of money, and 2) the Japanese, probably ruing the day they allowed the distribution rights to go to HG, will never compound their mistake by allowing HG's incompetence to further stain the Macross brand.",1173484800,"03 10, 2007"
"This movie reminded me of 'Armageddon' in that it was full of idiotic plot-holes.If you don't mind idiocy or a complete lack of any semblance of internal consistency in your stories then I suppose you might not loathe this pathetic excuse for a movie.I almost walked out several times and after it was over I wished that I had heeded my instincts; it never got better, only stupider. It vacillated between being utterly dull and spectacularly inane.Some of the visuals were okay. I liked that it was consistent with 'Alien' in a couple of ways (though it was completely *in*consistent in several other ways).I wish I could have my two hours and $15 back.

"Cache starts out with the disturbing discovery that a successful talk show host and his talented wife and son are being spied upon in their home and that the spy seems to know intimate details of their lives.  It's a great set up which deflates completely as we discover the identity of the spy and his agenda.  Despite the excellent cast, good acting, marvelous initial suspense and fine dialogue, the movie peters out into nothing.  What is hidden is not shameful or awful, just sad and unfortunate.  Hardly the earthshaking secret promised by the build-up.What is the shaming secret at the heart of the harassment of the talk show host?  Well, we learn that as a child of perhaps 8 or 10 years old, he resented his parents taking in an Algerian orphan boy whose immigrant parents were killed in the notorious 1961 riots in Paris.  The child manages to engineer an incident which casts the orphan in a bad light which turns the parents against the orphan, who is placed in an orphanage; the little orphan grows up to a low level job and a life in the lower middle class.  We are to believe that if only the orphan had been allowed to remain in this family, he'd have been as successful and had as many opportunities as the talk show host.This, then, is the ""awful"" secret of our talk show host: that a petty, malicious act committed by him as a child, is deemed to have ruined the orphan's life, for which our talk show host, now an adult, should be held responsible and an object of profound contempt.It is interesting, to say the least, that a child's actions would be judged by standards applicable to an adult; that a child, long before his brain had reached the developmental stage of being able to empathize with others, before attaining mental maturity, should be held responsible for understanding the meaning and consequences of his actions upon others.  This indicates a rather profound failure of understanding on the part of the director of human psychological development.One must also add that the director seems unaware of the profound social injustice of his nation and the lack of advancement for immigrants in France, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.  The idea that the orphan might have advanced and prospered in the France of the '60s and '70s, just as the talk show host did, for this is the implicit premise of the film, is a threadbare fantasy belied by the condition of immigrants and ethnic minorities in France today, packed into the banlieus circling the capital, a no go zone for the police.  Precious few like the fictional orphan of this film have ever escaped the banlieus.  This fantasy turns the film into a farce.Cache is a film which should itself be hidden.

"This is a generic boring movie with some guy who thinks he is the London version of Colombo. I got so bored with it that I skimmed, and skimmed, and skimmed, and skimmed...etc...etc NOTHING HAPPENS. This is pathetic. They should have called this movie ""the day in the life of a dork"" since the movie has what I call a slew of ""time killer scenes"" for example: we have time enough to watch this guy sleep, then time enough to watch him take a very long shower. Time enough to watch a girl dance. Time enough to watch him shower again. Then time to watch him take a long walk down a city sidewalk. This movie stinks, that's all there is to it. The definition of H E L L is being strapped to a chair for an eternity to watch this garbage over and over again. Anyone that would give this more than 3 stars either lives under a rock, or is in someway connected to the making of this movie",1112659200,"04 5, 2005"
"Martin Lawrence stars in this comedy, as ""Jamal"".  Jamal works for a medieval times amusement center, and takes a trip back to the true ""medieval times"" when he falls into the moat he is cleaning out.His character seems totally selfish in the beginning, but changes for the better by the end of the movie.  You could say there is a moral to the story.  Do unto others...I am not a big fan of Lawrence. My husband rented this.  Well, I actually liked it to some extent.  While it wasn't completely original with it's hip modern music thrown in...and time travel,... it as least has a bit of a twist to it.Instead of just playing Sly and the Family Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" and having the townsfolk dance around, Jamal teaches the musicians to play and sing to something hip enough for him to dance to.  This was my favorite part of the movie.  It was just a lot of fun to watch, and Lawrence was genuinely funny here.As far as the time travel part goes, he doesn't deliberately go back in time. At first, he thinks he is in the new competition for where he works, until the fair chambermaid, Victoria, tells him what year it really is.This wasn't a waste of time by any means. It was good for some light comedic entertainment.  To the big fans of Martin Lawrence, you will totally enjoy!",1019520000,"04 23, 2002"

"Guys, no offense, but this show sucks. Awful writing, acting not much better, implausible premise (always nice to have a plausible premise) and if Thomas Magnum isn't the most annoying, most selfish and immature character in the history of primetime television (no, not just those shorts) I don't know who is. Who would want this guy as his friend? For eight years?!? (Just one point: look how Magnum treats the Ferrari he's lucky enough to have access to. Is that how you'd drive someone's Ferrari? Spinning lawn and gravel every time he leaves the estate? Frankly, what an a--hole. (That's a small detail?Yeah.

"This movie was a big let-down. I LOVED the first two Mummy movies in the series and could watch them over and over. This one was written so bad that the lines could be laughed at throughout the entire thing (and I don't mean the comedic lines). The wife is a different person and is awful, son talks like John Wayne and is too old compared to the years that went by, and Jet Li was barely in the movie/had any lines. The special effects in this movie were mediocre in 1995 and that's saying something. The story of it completely broke off from what it was in the first two. The wife has no connection to her past like in the second one whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone that loves the first two. If you don't want to ruin the series and have not seen this movie, then don't even think about watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie.",1226448000,"11 12, 2008"

"Love this indie movie.This review is solely in regard to the QUALITY of this newest (2011/2012) DVD release.  As I own the previous release from the same studio and have compared them.In comparison, this newest DVD is 1) four full minutes shorter than the other version, which my DVD player's graphics proved after checking both DVDs on it, and which also can be seen in the 92-minute running time printed on the package of this newest version vs. the 96 minutes printed on the package of the older version (I haven't checked WHERE the footage is missing, but it's definitely not in the opening or closing credits being expanded or reduced, but elsewhere).2) This new DVD had 10 haphazardly started/ended ""chapters"" which start in really odd places--always in the middle of scenes!  And on the disc's menu, believe it or not, they are listed merely as ""Chapter One"", ""Chapter Two,"" etc., with NO other info-- no names for the scenes, no pictures . . .  Whereas on the preferred older DVD release, the menu for the chapters is a very fancy one, in the form of a train line map, and with a name for each chapter and a photo for each chapter.  FAR better than the new 2011/2012 DVD release.  The older DVD's chapters also start and end in logical, proper places.The film's print is identical on the old and the new DVDs, also it's the same aspect ratio: 1.85:1 and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.  It's sad that no improvement was made to the picture quality, but to be fair, it was excellent on both old and new versions, despite a bit of tiny squigglies in the backgrounds of both if one pays close attention.Even the older clamshell case is hard, whereas the new one's is soft, despite also being plastic.Buy the OLDER version of this DVD release, which is better in ALL ways.",1357776000,"01 10, 2013"

"Dr. Bernard Adrian (Boris Karloff) has been experimenting in his lab for years, trying to perfect a serum that will cure paralysis. Unfortunately, he needs human spinal fluid and the townsfolk think he's a nut. Thankfully, a circus comes to town, complete with animals. A vengeful trainer decides that torturing the go-rilla that killed his father is a dandy idea. This results in the ape escaping it's cage, wringing the trainer's neck, and lumbering away for it's obligatory  rampage. The unlucky trainer is brought to Dr. Adrian for treatment, where he is summarily killed and becomes Adrian's first spinal fluid donor. Drawn by the trainer's scent, the go-rilla visits Adrian's place by crashing through the window. Adrian stabs the go-rilla to death, skins it, wears the go-rilla suit, and pretends he's the wacky ape out on a kill spree! This is fortuitous, as his only vial of spinal fluid serum rolled off the table and smashed on the floor. Now, he can knock off some locals and harvest their bodily yuck. Humanity is saved! THE APE is a fun little movie, kept interesting by Boris' amiable yet homicidal character. Yes, the ape costume is ridiculous, but hey, the budget was probably around 50.

"Signs is one of those movies that - well - I can't agree with the press. I do not think M. Night is the next Spielberg. The one thing that Spielberg brings to his pictures that M. Night did only once in The 6th Sense, was a story. Signs has no story.Yes I have seen 6th and Unbreakable and I must say M. Night has the market on long, moving and drawn out shots. It seems to take forever to get from one place to another. Back to the story. The concept is cool and definitely movie material, however, as good as Mel Gibson is (and he is good in this), its just not interesting enough. The pay off at the ending was a disappointment and the wrapping of the aliens was very anti climactic. I don't want to ruin it for those of you who plan to see it soon, but be warned, the ending is NOT what you would expect.M. Night seems to have the press favoring him and I have no idea why. I think he is not better than a lot of other directors out there and I know there are many more out there who are better Chris Columbus, Jonathan Frakes, Jay Roach and Robert Redford to name a fewI love science fiction, I love Mel Gibson and Joaquin and I love good epic movies and even with all the ingredients like these - M. Night did not do this story justice. Why? Because there was no story and that disappointed me a lot! Sorry everyone - I got bored! 8-6-03.",1028592000,"08 6, 2002"

"Bad movie.  It's a very shallow story with a very simple concept that could have easily been represented in a 30 minutes show but instead is drawn out for 109 minutes.  About 2/3 of the movie is Scarlett walking or driving around Scotland.  The main concept is very easy to deduce.  Emotionless alien harvest humans for unknown reason but develops human feelings and conscious.  I did give an extra star for the visually stunning scenes and Scarlett Johansson, who I think is an average actor but actually did a good job with what little depth in the story.  One final note, the movie has a lot of graphic nudity.  Just making the point because I was a little caught off guard at the amount and explicitness.  I'm sure some will say it was essential to the moral of the story on how people are stripped of their dignity and humanity.  I personally think it was put in to showcase Scarlett's body and the movie makers added male nudity to try and show there was an artistic need.",1416096000,"11 16, 2014"

"OK, I loved the first movie. The Highlander (1986) is probably in my top 25 favorite movies of all time. Somehow the producers for Highlander 2 convinced Connery to reprise his role as Ramirez (probably the $3 million for 6 days works did the trick!).  Re-uniting Christopher Lambert and Connery had POTENTIAL.  Unfortunately, this potential was destroyed by a horrible script, ridiculous story, horrible new characters and poor acting. In short, they screwed this up BIG TIME.  In this edition of the DVD, many of the special effects have been digitally changed and remastered.  Although this pretty cool, it's still just putting lipstick on a pig.What I hated:* Really stupid is the plot line where Katana (Ironside) suddenly wants MacLeod dead after he's spent 500+ years in ""exile"" on earth. At this point in the film, MacLeod is in his 80's and at death's door anyway.  How do you expect us to believe this load of garbage?  I guess the creator's thought that if the audience were stupid enough to believe the Ramirez can come back from the dead after getting his head chopped off in the first Highlander, than the audience will believe ANYTHING.* The movie had the look and feel of a bad comic book from the 1930's yet the year was 2024.  What the hell is that all about?* Why did they have to show us backstory of the immortals (who they are , where they came from etc).  It ruined the mystique of the original movie!  Dumb decision on creator's part.* Michael Ironside's character aka General Katana - Mulcahy circa 1990: ""Hey Michael, this is what I want you to do to prepare for the role of the bad guy in this film.  go watch the original Highlander and pay close attention to Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.  We want you to copy that performace. Yeah, be like the new Kurgan or someting. Yeah, that's the ticket.""  Ummm, didn't work fellas.  I freaking hated Michael Ironside in this movie. Bad, bad, bad.* Virgina Madsen, as Louise Marcus, was the one who really killed this movie.  Her character was laughable at best and her acting was an embarrasement.  I was hoping that she bought the farm early in the movie.  Unfortunatley, we have to suffer from her performance to the very end.* Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb aka the two idiots from the Planet Zeist that come to kill MacLeod.  They were hilariously bad but even worse, once MacLeod chops off their heads (and this becomes immortal again - wha wha what?) he his a little boom boom with Lousie Marcus, whom he met like 5 minutes earlier.  To the Director:  please delete this scene when you do the Super Special Director's Cut.Final Thoughts:  I picked this DVD up in the bargain rack at Walmart for 5 bucks.  It was worth it to me becuase I laughed out loud numerous times when I viewed it.  Plus, there are tons of special features which were actually interesting.  In parting, it is true, there can be only ONE, and this is NOT the one. BUT, if you can pick it up for 5 bucks and you want a good laugh, Go for it!",1190592000,"09 24, 2007"

"Warrior (Gavin O'Connor, 2011)That the ending of Warrior is predictable from the moment the two sequences that set up our two main characters have finished is entirely irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this sublime piece of cinema, or at least it should be. Warrior is a simple story, simply told, that is carried on the backs of those two lead characters, and the acting ability of the actors who play them. There are many other things to enjoy about this movie indeed (even if you're not an MMA fan, or even a sports fan in general, and I am living testament to this), but the centerpiece is the perfect performances by Joel Edgerton (The Thing) and Tom Hardy (Inception). Neither of them has carried a major role before; both are usually found in minor supporting roles. I predict that, after Warrior, that will change rapidly.Edgerton and Hardy play brothers, Brendan Conlan and Tommy Riordan respectively. Both used to be MMA fighters. Brendan, after an ultimatum from his wife following a near-death experience, hung up the gloves and became a high school physics teacher; Tommy did...something else (the unfolding revelation of Tommy's missing years is a major subplot in the film, so saying what would be a spoiler). Their father Paddy (Affliction's Nick Nolte, and I used that 1998 effort to identify him because that's the last time I liked him in a movie this much) is a trainer and recovering alcoholic who, we get the impression, used to be something of a monster. Now all he wants is to be able to atone for his wrongdoings and make up with his kids. However, as Tommy says at one point in the film, the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. All of which is important, but has nothing to do with the main plot of the film: an entrepreneur has set up a winner-take-all MMA tournament with a five million dollar purse. Both brothers are cash-strapped, and both of them decide to go for it, Tommy under his father's tutelage, Brendan back with his old trainer Frank Campana (End of Watch's Frank Grillo).The obvious parallel here, to me, is with Wai Man Yip's ridiculous, but fun, 2003 comedy Anna in Kung Fu Land, which I watched a week or so before this without realizing how parallel the two films are; each is about half setup and then half competition (though Warrior spends much more time on character development even during the competition portion), with the same single-elimination winner-take-all tournament style, even with almost the same number of contestants (Anna's competition has fifteen, Warrior's sixteen), leading to a series of battles that expose the strengths and weaknesses of our main characters. The fight scenes are beautiful, the best I've seen since Girlfight, and with a refreshing lack of the ridiculous tendency in fight scenes these days to have slo-mo blood spray as soon as someone gets tapped with a daisy. But it's all leading exactly where you think it is, so if you dispense with the fighting as a draw here, all you have is these characters and the familial drama that surrounds them. And Gavin O'Connor (Miracle), who also co-wrote with Anthony Tambakis (his writing debut) and Cliff Dorfman (Entourage), knocks it out of the park. The family-drama side of the script is impressionist, light-handed, gives just enough to get you filling in the blanks yourself right up until the end (and gives you enough clues that the unanswered questions at the end are easily answerable with a bit of thinking). It's a very risky proposition, especially in a movie where the other half of the action has all the subtlety and impressionism of a sledgehammer to the face. And they pull it off tremendously. As I've stated a time or two, that is in no small part down to Edgerton and Hardy, who show the world that they are both forces to be reckoned with. This is an amazing piece of cinema, ironically one of the best-reviewed (83% at Rotten Tomatoes) and yet least-seen in first run (the movie made back just over half its $25 million budget), movies of 2011. If you were one of the legions that missed it in the theater, do what you must to see it now. It is a phenomenal film. **** ",1397520000,"04 15, 2014"
"Producer/director John Woo has no one but himself to blame for BLACKJACK,an action film/failed back door pilot that's as laughably bad as anything seen on MST3K.In its first scene of violence, ex-bodyguard Dolph Lundgren uses clumsy martial arts moves to defeat four thugs. Why they take turns having at Dolph and getting their collective ass kicked is not apparent. Again, in a sequence where Lundgren shoots it out with a number of hired guns, they don't appear or fire all at once, but singly, which gives him more than a sporting chance to survive.The story's equally lame.After he's nearly blinded by an explosion, our hero develops a phobia to the color white.Thus at times he's forced to wear very dark glasses.The near-public murder of a fashion model is kindling for a later parking garage fracas in which one of the good guys is severely bullet-wounded and left comatose. A subsequent hospital room scene is one of the better moments.Stupidity returns all too soon when Dolph saves the model from a pill OD not by walking her around but by doing a lively Spanish-flavored dance with her. It's revealed here that Lundgren has magical chiropractic abilities. Is there any problem ""Black Jack"" can't handle? Oh yah, the color white.Slow motion shootouts, motorbike tricks plus all the usual explosions and immolations parade by in what is ultimately a waste of two hours. Oh and let's not forget that initial tete  tete with our main baddie, a battle that occurs in a pool of.....milk! Jack and this scenery-chewer are sure to meet again before the credits roll; the only question is: will white triumph over black(jack)?",1415145600,"11 5, 2014"
"This is a tough one to rate, since 95% of the series deserves a 5+ star, but the bad parts were REALLY bad. In particular I was so annoyed by their choice of ""experts"" to add commentary throughout the series that an otherwise great series gets 3 stars. Brian Williams was the worst. A man blessed with good looks, paid millions of dollars a year to read a teleprompter to deliver the evening news, is now an expert on all aspects of the history of the world. I was waiting for the History Channel to turn to Sarah Palin for her knowledge of the ice age and Elizabeth Warren for her first hand experience with American Indians.Apparently this annoys a lot of people, since it was the basis of the South Park spoof on the History Channel. In that episode of the cartoon comedy, fourth grader Stan Marsh was interviewed (""Dr. Stan Marsh"") by the History Channel for his expertise on the role that space aliens played in the first Thanksgiving.A Feb 14, 2015 update: Brian Williams can now add disgraced liar to his resume.",1355875200,"12 19, 2012"

"I pretty much make sure to see every sci-fi, and most action and superhero movies, and I found Man of Steel pretty dull, humorless, and irritatingly witless. It recycles nearly every silly trope and cliche of such movies, it almost felt like a mash-up.  Most of the plot makes no sense, Stuff from the comics that made no sense has been changed, into new stuff that makes no sense.  Example: Krypton has a world government and NO ENEMIES in the known universe - but they seem to be armed to the teeth? Krypton is defended (from who?) by General Zod - who is short-sighted, uncharismatic, and has poor impulse control and anger management issues. And is genetically designed for his job.  Sure, seems legit.I hoped to see some of the magic moments of Clark's childhood discovery of his powers (not to mention teenage pranks), but - there's none of that, just angst and confusion.  The special effects are beautiful, I'll give it that.",1386633600,"12 10, 2013"

"Wow, did season 5 fail to deliver.  Even if you hadn't heard that the series had been cancelled, season 5 felt like they were just trying to find a way to end the show and that any old way would do.  They tie up the cliff-hanger from season 4 fairly quickly, and everything starts to go downhill pretty quickly.  They force in a romance at the last second that should never, EVER have been attempted, they throw in yet another member of Claudia's family in a way that felt really random, they utilized an old villain rather than trying anything new.  The finale was disappointing in every conceivable way, particularly with what they did with Pete and Myka (which felt like it was written by someone who thought that the romance in Twilight was a little too well thought out).  If it weren't for the adorable father/daughter-esque relationship between Artie and Claudia, I would say that season 5 managed to do absolutely everything wrong.  I would recommend just pretending that the show ended after Season 4 rather than subjecting yourself to this.",1401235200,"05 28, 2014"

"This family road movie is more about the journey than the destination. Filled with amazing actors and a subtly moving plot, 'Arcadia' is one step ahead of most independent films.Tom (Academy Award nominated actor John Hawkes; ""The Sessions"", ""Winter's Bone"") plays the father who abruptly gathers his three children into an old station wagon to travel from New England to Arcadia, California.Tom has a new job and Mom won't be joining them until later, adding to the mystery. Eldest sister, Caroline (Kendall Toole in a breakout performance) is joined by moody, middle daughter Greta (played with explosive calmness by Ryan Simpkins - (""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Surveillance"", which gave her a Best Actress award at the NYC Film Festival - the first child to ever win). The youngest member of the family is Ty Simpkins (""Iron Man 3"" and Ryan's real little brother).The journey is full of Tom filling the time exalting an assortment of wild stories, assurances and a great new life. Caroline is slightly removed, having just left her boyfriend behind. Greta is a quietly smoldering pre-teen having her own personal issues and Nat is the young innocent observer. Tom's moods are unexplainable and disturbing, frequently trapping his three children in dangerous and confusing situations.Although a low budget film that doesn't make an effort to make the cross country scenery seem like anything other than southern California, it focuses on a strong and sophisticated plot.Director Olivia Silver does a wonderfully balanced and painful job of story-telling. She presents each family member collectively and individually, reacting to sometimes frightening and all too real situations. As an American family situation, this portrayal suggests it is all too common. This film was supplied by Film Movement for review.",1373414400,"07 10, 2013"

"`Fly Me to the Moon' is a pretty average animation about three flies who stow away on the Apollo 11 mission and make their way to the moon. There are lots of `in-jokes' if you are aware of the original mission and Buzz Aldrin even appears at the end to say a brief message. The animation is pretty basic, with under par character animation, although saying that some of the weightless scenes were better than expected. The story is simple and nothing too great, but for an 80 minute animation to keep the kids entertained this should do the job well enough. There's not too much for an adult audience though. Compared to some other animations out there (I.e. nearly everything from Pixar!) this lacks a certain something, but in it's own right it is a perfectly watchable film.

"Staged for a very small theater in 1976, director Trevor Nunn gives us an exceptionally bleak production in shades of black, grey, sepia, and the occasional red of spilled blood...with no sets and minimal props, and lots and lots of mist. The costuming is pared down to a simple ""non-descript"" look, and overall, it's very effective.With a fine cast of Royal Shakespeare Company members backing them, Sir Ian and Dame Judi shine brilliantly as the devilish couple. McKellan looks handsome and his disintegration is mesmerizing...his big scene with the witches is fabulous (and terrific witches they are ! Susan Dury, Judith Harte, Marie Kean). Dench is phenomenal! I love the inhuman wail she lets out in the sleepwalking scene. It's chilling, and unforgettable.There are so many intriguing Macbeth productions available, like the Orson Welles film, and the visually entertaining Polanski/Jon Finch version, but this ""bare bones"" one is my favorite, where the play's the thing.",1018569600,"04 12, 2002"

I don't believe that ""unbroken"" is the appropriate title for his life story. Rather, ""Broken, Then Redeemed"" would be more fitting.That being said, he movie allowed me to more realistically understand what POW's have gone through - not easy to watch. I wouldn't recommend this for young children. Perhaps teens at the youngest.",1429401600,"04 19, 2015"
"Shy Victor's parents arrange a marriage for him, thinking that he will never marry on his own.  His parents are newly rich, so they immediately want to pair him up with someone from old money.  They arrange the marriage to Victoria, a young woman who's just as quiet and retiring as Victor.  But somehow, in the space of a few minutes, true love ignites between the two.  As soon as it does, however, the fates conspire to keep them apart.  First Victor can't remember his vows.  Then the priest sends him away, saying that Victor doesn't want to marry.  Then, when Victor finally practices his vows (thinking he's by himself) and gets them right, he ends up married to a young dead woman who was murdered for her dowry years ago.Tim Burton directed the film starring Johnny Depp.  The two have worked together before on several projects, including EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, and other.  Both are known for working with the bizarre and stylized worlds/characters.CORPSE BRIDE is a simple tale, actually, and that really shines through.  If Burton and the writers didn't take this from a fable or myth, I'd be surprised.  It's just too natural.  The stop-motion animation is beautiful, and the two worlds (of the living and of the dead) are well thought-out and visually striking.  Everything ties in neatly at the end.I watched it on HD DVD and found the production to be outstanding.  The sound wasn't Lossless, but it was really good and did well on my surround sound system.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans will want to pick up CORPSE BRIDE.  Anyone wanting something unusual that you won't see every day would be interested in picking this one up for rent for movie night.  You'll find something (story, animation, or characters) that will spark your imagination.",1160870400,"10 15, 2006"

"This is one of my favorite films from Director Ron Howard.  It's a highly original sci-fi story that is more character and story driven that is not heavily reliant on CGI, unlike a lot of what passes today for summer entermainment.

They store their lifepods in a swimming pool that some local retirees use and to the surprise of the seniors the pool contains a rejuvenating lifeforce.

She starts off with one boyfriend, and quickly gets rid of him, because she likes someone else that she is working with. He starts to get a little stale as well, so she replaces him with the other guy that they are working with.I would find it more interesting if there was a script intact. I could deal with ad-libbing if it were amusing or enjoyable, (not to say that this was ad-libbed, but it seems as though it was) but most of the time, you had to listen carefully, because there was a lot of mumbling, and to be honest, the characters weren't that compelling. They also seemed as if they could learn some social skills as well.And, of course, there is Hannah. She seems to be floating through life, not a care in the world, except for who she is going to sleep with next. She wasn't intelligent like the men at work claimed. She was so self absorbed, so annoying, and it was really hard to listen to her voice, quite honestly. I have read many books and seen movies where the characters are not good people or I don't empathize with them, but at least in those situations, the characters were intriguing! The conversations were so awkward, with so many pregnant pauses, and everyone interrupting each other.

Tracy plays his friend who is trying to get money to pay back Jamaican gangsters for 10 wheelchairs that cost $12,000 dollars each.  Yea, I thought that was silly, but at the same time, uniquely funny.  And so from there the adventure begins.Eventually, Tracy's character, Lee John, gets an idea to rob a church.

"How this movie has the positives reviews is easily explainable. Within the last decade we've witnessed an aggressive dumbing down of society with music, pop culture, fashion, life style, and of course movies. This movie embodies the shilling of atrocious acting, recycled concept and script writing, lousy cinematography, cheesy set design and costumes, and out right plagiarism in nearly every scene.Even the lead ""actor"" (if you can call him that) Karl Urban is so unconvincing in this role due to his limited acting skills, it becomes clearly apparent  right out of the gate that the director or producers insisted to elevate his character, he adapted a (laughable) attempt to impersonate Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" character voice. It's not just pathetic, it distracting throughout the entire movie. What the movie lacks in all phases of intriguing and captivating movie making, it makes up for it with gratuitous body parts, blood, guts, ridiculous and pointless swearing that isn't even supported by this lousy script. How is it possible that near every actor in this movie could possibly be so unconvincing, unschooled in the basic tenants of acting, and land a gig? Simple: It's called feed the masses crap and they will like it. This flick is as dumbed down as any I've ever seen.  A movie so bad, I'm actually appalled at myself for even watching.I won't go on anymore other than to say, I warned you.",1386720000,"12 11, 2013"
"So glad I waited to watch this through Prime and didn't drop the money on a ticket or a disc. This is just terrible, and I'm not even saying that in comparison with the first. I've never seen the original. This could have been much better realized as a television series, with time taken to explore all the challenges that a scenario like this would actually create. As it is, I couldn't suspend my disbelief that this group of characters could manage to do anything but be captured or killed on Day 1. What a waste of time for all involved.",1425081600,"02 28, 2015"
"This is one of the best movies ever made. I could be feeling down and just putting it on brings a smile to my face (if not outright laughter.

The younger generation might know ""Mannequin"", no other version can compare and Audrey Hepburn is perfect in the role of Eliza Doolittle. Rex Harrison as Prof. Higgins.

"Kicking and Screaming is about the son of a man who's obsessed with being the best. Will Ferrell plays the son and Robert Duvall plays the dad. When Ferrell gets the chance to be soccer coach he takes it because his son needs a new coach. He soon finds out that the team is awful. So he brings in his dad's arch enemy and nextdoor neighbor to help him out. He just happens to be Mike Ditka. He helps the team improve but they still aren't winning. Ditka then comes up with idea to bring in two italian kids who work at a  family deli and who happen to be great at soccer. Their dad says that meat comes first but after a lot of begging he gives in and lets them play.  They're so good that Ferrell just lets them do all the work and together they start winning. Besides winning going to Ferrell's head, Ditka gets him into drinking coffee to relax him. Ferrell soon gets horribly addicted to coffee though and turns into a mad man. Just like his dad benched him when he was little, he finds himself benching his own son.  The movie is nutty and often pretty funny.  Mike Ditka is surprisingly very funny too and him and Ferrell have chemestry. While Duvall is entertaining as well as a mean old man. Ferrell can be overly cruel here though. It's more sad than funny when a grown-man is calling kids names and pushing them hard to the ground. Just like when Adam Sandler beat the crap out of little kids with dodge balls in Billy Madison. If that doesn't bother you, you should like the movie. Ferrell is about as loud and off the wall as he was in Old School. So if you liked him as Frank the Tank, then you should like Frank the Tank Coaches Soccer. Oops I mean, Kicking and Screaming.",1129766400,"10 20, 2005"

"Left Behind: World at War is better than Tribulation Force, which was a terrible movie!  The story was similar to the books, but different in some ways.  I liked how they presented the gospel.  They could have, however, covered a few more days.  With the content of this movie, it wasn't the best one to call world at war.  The war just started, but they didn't go very far into it.  They could have continued with the war.  With twelve books in the series, they can't be doing one movie on only 40 pages of one book.  Anyway, it's a movie worth watching once.

"A Little Bit of Heaven turns out to be a major waste of time. Ever wait through a movie hoping that it might get better? Kate Hudson is a good solid actress but this movie did nothing for her career. It unfortunately ends like ""Love Story"" but the script doesn't help what otherwise would be good actors portraying genuine characters. The young Doctor introduces himself and we have to be told that he is Mexican-Jewish which is ridiculous and totally irrelevant. Do real people introduce themselves with the qualification that they are Catholic-Canadian or Danish-Lutheran, American-Baptist, etc. immediately after giving their name? Like ""Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm German-American Episcopalian. It would be refreshing to watch a movie without having to know what religion the people are since, for the most part, its irrelevant to the story. I give this movie one star for cinematography, set design, sound quality, etc.  A love story? No way.  The relationship is superficial at best and Mr. Bernal as the doctor doesn't make it work nor is he at all believable. The movie starts with wild kisses and hugs but its for her African-American neighbor who just happens to be gay. This movie leaves one wondering if all of America is mostly homosexual and all doctors are Jewish. Good grief give the non-Jewish and non-homosexual community a decent break and try to mix the characters up just a bit to represent something close to what America currently is and what it is all about. She dies of colon cancer in the end so the movie is a total ""downer"".",1348185600,"09 21, 2012"
My nieces made me watch this one by manacling me to the chair.  Just kidding. ;)  Heh. There's some good lines that actually made me laugh a couple of times and the music is fairly good to good if you like musicals.  The villain didn't seem to properly overlap with the heroes though so at times it felt like there were two stories taking place.  Themes of romantic love are rampant.

"Purchased this for Christmas, with great expectations, as I've seen most of the shows over the 15 years. While there are many memorable moments on this 3 disc set, there are some truly forgettable! Mean Street Posse, Big Bossman Sympathy & Musical Chairs with Eugene are some lowlights. There are some great matches, some very funny & shocking moments, the majority provided by Stone Cold & The Rock. There are many great matches from Shawn Michaels on this set, however he comes across as the golden boy of WWE as he's shown in 6 matches and many promos, where as many other superstars are not shown at all or nearly as much! No Randy Savage or Hulk, OK there best was probably before this but surely there must've been something of note. Nothing shown on the nation of domination. Also disappointing that there are no extras on any of the 3 discs. Finally, while Todd Grisham did an admirable job introducing many segments, it would've been far more interesting to have those involved in the segments comment. Overall a good compilation but one that I would hire rather than purchase.",1262563200,"01 4, 2010"

"Parents should be aware that this movie is NOT a fantasy/sci-fi film despite the way it's being marketed. I think the studio decided that most viewers would have read the book before seeing it, and therefore decided that the somewhat-misleading campaign was okay. I'd be very angry if I had watched it with younger children. If you are hoping for a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Harry Potter""-type film, STAY AWAY!This movie is entertaining for adults and teens, with its fabulous tales of make-believe and the dilemma we can all relate to - children fleeing bullies and the cruel world that is public school - but tragedy keeps it from being a real family movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 12 or 13. I expected to see a fantasy movie, and this was anything but.The best thing about ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is not its terrific special effects, or even its story, but the fabulous performances from its youthful stars. I hope to see more of them in the future, and hope they don't get lost in Hollywood's child-star mill.But, again, it is NOT a film for children. A friend compared his family's experience to him bringing a puppy home for his kids and then shooting it in front of them. This is most emphatically NOT a movie to share with your children, unless you want to see them cry bitterly - and NOT remember the movie with fondness afterwards.",1189900800,"09 16, 2007"
"Surprisingly good.  I liked how I was able to get involved with this movie without being distracted by who was playing Mr. Hitchcock, though of course the man playing Mr. Hitchcock did all of the work to get that done.

"As an American who has been living in the UK since February 1999, I was fortunate enough to have grown up in Georgia watching The Three Stooges. And thanks to my DVD collection I still do. Therefore, I lamented the fact that the new film would not be released on the big screen in the UK until Friday, the 17th of August, well after the USA theatrical release date of the 13th of April. However, during a recent vacation in Florida, I was amazed and delighted to be able the buy the new film on DVD during the same week it was released. I still can't believe that I was able to sit and watch the film last night in my living room, along with the deleted/extended scenes and the other extras more than a week before it will be shown here in the UK for the very first time. As for the movie itself, it was well-worth the wait. The three leads are nothing short of marvelous as Larry, Moe and Curly. They so captured the whole essence of the original Three Stooges. The Farrelly Brothers are to be commended for (mostly) keeping the comedy clean and suitable for the whole family. I for one would love to see a sequel, if it was of the quality of this film. As for the delayed UK big-screen release, I don't believe that the comedy of The Three Stooges is very well known enough here to be a success. Much in the same way that a lot of British comedy would not be very widely known in the USA. I do feel that The Three Stooges type of comedy doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you are like me and are a devoted fan, you will not be disappointed in this new film. It is a fitting tribute to what made The Three Stooges so great, timeless and immortal.",1344470400,"08 9, 2012"

Give us, the fans, a break.  Release these on DVD and stop wasting our time.

The characters, costumes, and dialog are too clean and theatrical stage-like.

"WWFKING OF THE RING 2000The thing I miss most about wrestling now days is the King of the Ring PPV, honestly it may have been my favorite of all the events. It has always been a tossup between this and the Royal Rumble because I love tournaments and battle royals. So I felt the need to go back and watch one of these events. I decided on this one mainly because I haven't seen it in a while.1.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]RIKISHI VS CHRIS BENOIT-really good and quick opening match do to the actions of ""the crip... er...murderer"". Rikishi had taken the I-C title from Benoit so he was looking for revenge. He finds it minutes into the match as he attacks Rikishi with a chair earning a DQ. That of course advances Rikishi into the next round.2.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]EDDIE GUERRERO VS VAL VENIS-excellent match right here that was very competitive. Both men looked great here and the outside interference from Chyna and Trish added to the fun. Great back and forth that sees Val getting the win.3.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]BULL BUCHANAN VS CRASH HOLLY-this match was the typical bug man vs little guy match. Bull is dominating the entire match but makes that one mistake and gets rolled up real quick for Crash to win.4.[QUARTER FINAL MATCH]CHRIS JERICHO VS KURT ANGLE-we get another good match right here and why not looking at who is participating in this match. Not as fast paced as some of their previous matches but still a good match. These two work very well together and I never knew how much I missed the Steph/Jericho or Steph/Angle stuff until re-watching this match. Angle gets the win here after the stuff with Steph I was talking about.5.[TAG TITLE ELIMINATION MATCH]TOO COOL VS EDGE & CHRISTIAN VS T&A VS THE HARDY BOYZ-I am a huge tag team wrestling fan so any time I get a match like this I am excited. This is a great elimination match for the tag titles with some good spots for all teams. But it is Edge & Christian that shine the most here starting with their five second pose [man I miss those]. They end up winning the belts after Christian hits Brian with one of the straps but prior to that they were getting beat by Too Cool. I still can't believe that Scotty's worm was so popular, it still cracks me up. Of course some of the best moments happened between T&A and The Hardy's, so everyone was represented well in this match although it was a little too short for some reason to me.6.[SEMI FINAL MATCH]RIKISHI VS VAL VENIS-this was a short match mush like Rikishi's first one earlier. There was an actual end to this one as Rikishi defeated Val after catching and slamming him. but after the match when Trish was going to demolished by Rikishi Val saves her and attacks Rikishi with the steps, thus setting things up for later.7.[SEMI FINAL MATCH]KURT ANGLE VS CRASH HOLLY-I remember thinking at the time that there was actually a chance Crash was going to win this. I knew and was from the beginning always rooting for Kurt to win but there was that chance. The match was a good but short one in which Angle came out on top.8.[HARDCORE TITLE EVENING GOWN MATCH]PAT PATTERSON VS GERALD BRISCO-this match was made only for comedic value. I am not to sure if it was as funny as they wanted but it was still worth a chuckle or two. All I can say is I was very happy that Crash returns to the ring to take the Hardcore title.9.[HANDICAP TABLE/DUMPSTER MATCH]ROAD DOGG, X PAC, & TORRI VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-the main thing about this match was Buh Buh wanted very badly to put Torri threw a table. So because of that The Dudley's had to win a table's match while DX had to win a dumpster match. This was a fun match with all five putting forth a great effort, from double team moves to weapons being used we get it all. The match seems like it is going the way of The Dudley's as they make Road Dogg and X-Pac eat wood. But as they are going for Torri they are attacked from the back by Dogg and Pac and put into the dumpster. Thus DX wins the match and start making their way to the back, only they forget about Torri. This sets up a couple of 3-D's and Torri taking some Dudley wood.10.[FINALS]KURT ANGLE VS RIKISHI-in the finals we would have the Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle against the injured Rikishi. Now this was another good match with Rikishi trying to fight through the pain that was inflicted against him by Benoit and Val Venis. Kurt was too much for him in the end as he became the King of the Ring. I remember being so happy that he won this, since his debut he had always been a favorite of mine. IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.11.[WWF TITLE SIX MAN TAG MATCH]-TRIPLE H, VINCE MCMAHON, & SHANE MCMAHON VS THE ROCK, THE UNDERTAKER, & KANE-good main event over all here as the McMahon family unit could lose the title for Triple H if any of them were pinned by any one from the other team. This of course would come into play as Taker, Kane, and Rock would not let each other get the pin at any time. The action gets slow at times but overall it was a good match. The last third of the match is by far the best and that choke slam Shane takes is crazy. But it would be the Rock getting the win and title after pinning Vinnie Mac after a Rock Bottom.This was a good event in my opinion and much better than people give it credit for. Plus I am a huge Kurt Angle fan so it is a plus that he won. I remember watching this on PPV and rooting for him the whole entire night. So because of his victory I would have to say this was a pretty good event. Also I didn't hate any of the matches; thankfully that hardcore match was short.",1368748800,"05 17, 2013"
"""The Boondocks"" cartoon series is based on the comic strip created by Aaron McGrude in 1999. Although many people have a different opinion as to what it is about, it's life seen through the eyes of African Americans and takes a look at their culture, racism, politics and everyday life.After watching the series I knew it was in for a treat. I went back and looked at the comic strips and also enjoyed it. The comics started around 1997 then many years later here we have the cartoon series about the Freemans: Huey, Riley and Grandpa.This series again is very much in your face, at times satirical, philosophical and always entertaining. It seems at times that Aaron does like exploit the use of ""N"" word in the series. However, ignoring this series is guaranteed to make you laugh.The character of Uncle Ruckus (also on the strip) is a racist black man who hates his own race and praises white people. Tom Dubois is a successful black man (who is combo of an Uncle Tom mixed with W.E.B Dubois) often serving as the voice of reason yet at times being very conservative and conforming to the white man's world if you will.My favorite episode of the bad are ""The Trial of R. Kelly"" , ""The Return of King"" (a what if episode looking at what would occur if Martin Luther King Jr. would still be alive), ""Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner"", and ""A Date with the health inspector"" (a great look at racial profiling) and ""Passion of the Ruckus"".The DVD sets for the first season come loaded with special features which include: Audio and Video commentary for the first ten episodes, a making of feature, unaired promos for CN, an animatics looks at the series and deleted scenes.The commentaries are decent. Sometimes the crew does get caught in watching the episode instead of commenting on them but they do provide enough information to give you an insight as to what it was like in making the series. For instance, Aaron mentions that the original opening was going to be a Star Wars like opening but for whatever reason it never happened.All in all, a great set to own if you haven't seen the episodes then this is a must have.",1182470400,"06 22, 2007"

"Now I am not one of those who is anti-Barbie for body image.  I think the previous animated Barbies were just lovely.  Yes, Barbie has always been thin, but in previous movies she looked healthy and trim, not as though she was starving.  I love the animation style (body and face) of the previous Barbie movies such as ""A Mermaid's Tale"" or ""Fashion Fairy Tale"".  Even last year's offering ""Secret Door"" was better than this.In this movie, ""Princess Power"", Barbie has toothpick legs and arms, as do her friends.  Her hair is an ugly brassy blond, as opposed to the previous gold or platinum.  The hair was animated as a thick mass of helmut, with no movement to it or stray pieces.  The facial features are unrealistic and cartoony, with ugly shading to make her appear even more gaunt.  She does not look at all like a powerful superhero, and she doesn't even look like the Barbie doll.We own over 10 Barbie movies.  But if they continue to be put out with this style and fashion, we will no longer be purchasing.See my attached comparison to see for yourself how emaciated and anorexic-thin this Barbie looks.",1426896000,"03 21, 2015"

This was the first movie I'd purchased produced in Turkey, and the quality is excellent. They don't make movies like this in Hollywood.

"It is great to finally see Dennis Quaid play a character with personality again! Lately, it seems like he plays the same scarred, emotionless character, over and over again. It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making.",1381017600,"10 6, 2013"

This excellent movie tells us it is possible to fulfill our potential, even achieve greatness, without money and the support systems it can buy.  With perseverance and love it's possible to pick oneself up again and if need be, yet again.  And to heal.  The horrendous ongoing cost of bullying is made evident by Jonny Lee Milleras sensitive portrayal of Graeme Obree. The bullies who tormented him grew up to be bullies.  We've all met them.

"I thought George Reeves was dead.  Besides, didn't he play Superman, not the Devil?  And -- What's that?  George Reeves isn't in the movie?  It's *Keanu* Reeves?... Oh.Okay, but what's with Charlize Theron, the Devil doesn't chat her up?  The Devil doesn't ask her to stand on a mirror?  The Devil doesn't order out and ask her to play hide the salami?  What kind of a loser of a Devil is this?What?  There's nothing in Aristotle's theory of dramatics that says Charlize Theron has to get hit on by the Devil?... Oh, okay.But, but -- but what about Al Pacino, what's his part in this story?  Oh, *he's* the devil!  What, because he was in The Godfather?  Because he's Italian?  (Prejudice!  Prejudice!)  And I suppose Charlize Theron never dated Italians, is that it?!What's this fellow ""Keanu"" supposed to be anyway, Hawaiian?  What was he Actor of the Year in Oahu?  Send him back to his little grass shack.  I bet he never met Don Ho.  Did he ever say Hi-ho to Don Ho?  Do they let Italians into Hawaii?  What's the Devil's position on that?  And why wasn't Charlize Theron wearing a hula skirt in this flicker?  I'm not clear.Anyway, the Devil's not such a bad guy.  He was a pretty popular dude up to the 14th century.  That's when he made a big mistake and hired a really awful publicist -- Gina Bellapartes.  A dead ringer for Charlize Theron.  Italian, a great body, but she couldn't type a lick.  Which, the licking part, the Devil got to later on.That woman sent Beelezebub's career into a tailspin.  Hey!  Maybe that's why they got Al Pacion to play the Devil!  *His* career is in a tailspin, no? -- He's never been to Hawaii. -- George Reeves is still dead. -- And God is in his heaven.By gosh, by golly, it all makes sense now!",1258502400,"11 18, 2009"

"Joe Cornish's ATTACK THE BLOCK is a great alien invasion film that isn't really about aliens at all.  Sure, it's got aliens.  But it's about the kids - it's about anger and rage and disappointment and what it feels like to grow up disenfranchised and disrespected and lost and hopeless.  Fifteen-year-old Moses is bitter and looks much older than he really is.  He lives alone with his ne'er-do-well uncle in a ghetto neighborhood in London.  He and his hoodie friends roam the streets attacking innocent passersby, talking trash, and hiding from the cops.  We don't like Moses or his friends - they reminded me of Alex and his ""droogs"" in Kubric's ""Clockwork Orange.""  But as the film progresses we come to suspect that Moses is a product of the world in which he lives.  ""Actions have consequences,"" Joe Cornish tells us in this film.  Moses's decision to attack a young woman named Sam and his decision to track and kill a strange creature that slashes his face have consequences - and those consequences are horrible.  But at the same time, Moses himself is seen as the consequence of so many other people's actions - his uncle who is ""here and there"" but mostly missing; the police who seem clueless and incompetent; the adults who should be role models but who are selling drugs or shooting up the place.  We don't like Moses, but we come to understand him.  And actor John Boyega is amazing playing this young man.  He's anger personified, but there's so much more there under the surface.  Boyega's eyes alone communicate a world of emotion and experience.All that said, I must admit that the aliens themselves are a bit disappointing.  We see very little of the first alien until it's dead, and even then we never get a good look at it (I didn't mind that so much - in fact Cornish might have been wise to follow this same plan for the rest of the film as well).  The second wave of aliens, however, presents more of a problem for me.  The aliens honestly look like the grass creature things from Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" (""Scrunts"" - sort of big shaggy bear-like creatures with lots of teeth).  This is not a good thing.  I know this is a low-budget film, so special effects will be limited, but these creatures just don't say ""aliens"" to me.  They were scary and strange, but I couldn't quite see them as traveling through space.But since I really don't think this movie is about the aliens, I can't complain too much about how they actually look (and maybe Cornish's point is that ""aliens"" come in many forms and attack from many directions).  ATTACK THE BLOCK is an extremely exciting movie about the struggle to remain human in the face of attacks from all sides (and it's not an easy struggle).  By the time we get to the film's climax, Moses is no longer the angry fifteen-year-old hoodlum we see in that opening scene. He's changed, and so have we as viewers.ATTACK THE BLOCK is surprising on many levels.  It's worth watching.  It's worth buying.  I loved it.",1320451200,"11 5, 2011"

"Intelligent stories that really draw you in. Great acting, direction and cinematography. AND music! Science fiction is wonderful for being able to express ideas that would otherwise never see the light of day, and both of these movies feature sinister conspiracies or incredible contrasts and truths about life on our dear little rock. There's a terrific scene in ""Five Million Years to Earth"" aka ""Quatermass and the Pit"" with a bunch of ""normal"" guys using new-found psychic abilities to stone to death another guy who's not one of them -- no dialogue, but true horror. Both movies feature disquieting ideas. Quatermass is an impressive character, played by two different actors. There's another Quatermass movie out there called ""The Creeping Unknown"" but it's not on a par with these two movies. ""Quatermass and the Pit"" builds to a climax where an alien intelligence takes over London and -- well,  you've got to see it. Both stories are complicated and if you're a science fiction fan you will find them *delectable* -- absolutely worth the money on their own and if you buy this set you'll be getting a real deal. Two of the best science fiction films in my modest-but-considered science fiction collection. Truly impressive films.

"Someday in the near future, perhaps, some enterprising young scholar will write a lengthy dissertation on Burt Reynolds's storied cinematic career. I know I would like to know how an actor of such populist appeal in the 1970s could plunge into the depths of ignominy by the 1980s and 1990s. Of course Burt is in the midst of a renaissance since his turn in ""Boogie Nights"" a few years back, reemerging as a sort of world weary Hollywood elder statesman of the type William Holden used to be a couple of decades ago. My ponderings about the ups and downs of Reynolds's career inspired me to check out a couple of his earliest films recently, and I started with the 1973 backwoods romp ""White Lightening."" Why not? I've already watched ""The Longest Yard"" so many times that I could probably reproduce the entire script from memory. And as for ""Deliverance,"" well, that picture is more of an ensemble effort than a vehicle for Reynolds. No, ""White Lightening"" is a good place to start because it develops in embryonic form the type of character Burt would cultivate to fullest effect in ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" his most successful film and probably the apogee of his career.""White Lightening"" introduces us to Bobby ""Gator"" McKlusky (Reynolds), a renowned bootlegger currently serving his second sentence for smuggling hooch. Gator is doing his time in the stir the easy way, working in the shop fixing up cars and generally hamming it up with his fellow inmates and the prison staff. Everyone likes Gator and Gator tends to like everyone around him. Then tragedy strikes when McKlusky's sister shows up to tell him that their brother wound up dead in a swamp. Since their brother was a straight arrow and a college student, both are mystified as to why he would fall victim to foul play. When Gator discovers that a corrupt sheriff by the name of J.C. Connors (Ned Beatty) might have something to do with the murder, he walks out of prison with the goal of making things right. The authorities track him down before he gets very far, but his escape and the reasons for it bring in some federal agents and a dangerous offer. If Gator will go undercover and gather evidence against Connors's various illegal schemes, the feds will let McKlusky walk away from the rest of his sentence. Of course, Gator agrees to the proposal because he thinks it will allow him to seek personal revenge against Connors.The feds tell Gator to go see one Dude Watson (Matt Clark), a parolee with a long list of liquor violations, as an in to Connors's action. Watson wants no part of Gator, however, but eventually goes along with the plan when he realizes he has no choice. It is Watson who introduces McKlusky to moonshine runner Roy Boone (Bo Hopkins), and before too long Gator is in like gold with this man and his girlfriend Lou (Jennifer Billingsley). Boone helps his new pal get work with big time liquor manufacturer Big Bear (R.G. Armstrong), a very dangerous individual who trusts no one for very long. But he comes to trust Gator, grudgingly, until a series of incidents reveal exactly whom McKlusky is really working for. Connors resorted to a little torture to divulge this piece of information, which results in the abduction of Gator and Lou by Big Bear's sweaty associates. Faced with certain death, McKlusky manages to escape (of course) and wreak his own brand of down home vengeance on the crooked cop. And he does it without the help of the feds or the state authorities. I'm not giving anything away when I say that the climatic scene involves a big car chase. You knew there would be a car chase, right? If not, you don't belong here!I liked ""White Lightening"" even though the pace of the film tends to drag. Reynolds does a pretty nice job in his role, and even gets a few opportunities to show some range with in his scenes with Lou as well as in a scene where he talks about the pain of losing his brother. Ned Beatty plays the corrupt southern cop with great aplomb, letting us know his brutal nature without taking the character over the top. What really works in the film is the great atmosphere. It's obvious director Joseph Sargent shot the majority of the film in the Deep South. The dismal swamp seen in the opening credits, the gravel back roads hemmed in by vegetation, the claustrophobically small town, and the ramshackle buildings out in the boonies fairly screams ""THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED IN THE SOUTH AND WE'RE DARN PROUD OF IT!"" The set pieces and locations are so good you can practically feel the humidity and heat wafting out of your DVD player. And that's a good thing. It gives the film a realism lacking in other movies in this particular genre. Throw in the car chases, a few fistfights, and some southern humor and you've got all the fixings for a fun way to spend a couple of hours.Unfortunately, the DVD version of ""White Lightening"" leaves a lot to be desired. The picture transfer is fullscreen, not widescreen, and the quality looks below average. How so? Scenes shot in the dark look really dark, so dark it's hard to see what's going on. Moreover, the only extra included on the disc is a trailer. While I don't always listen to (or appreciate) commentary tracks on DVDs, I would like to hear Burt Reynolds's comments on this movie. I'm somewhat of a completist when it comes to this actor's films, which in this instance means I want a commentary track. If you haven't seen it yet, give ""White Lightening"" a shot; it's far superior to the rather lackluster sequel ""Gator"" made several years later.",1112313600,"04 1, 2005"

"This is another movie I wanted to like but ultimately can not recommend.The acting was top notch and the effects and visual sequences were simply amazing. However given all these positive things, the story was the failure here. Also the incredible emphasis on violence, brutality and blood.This is one of the ""most"" violent films I have seen in recent memory, and I have seen Kill Bill many times.Unlike Kill Bill where the violence is over the top and entertaining this movie is very hard and real. We see good or innocent people murdered and tortured with no care. It is just too much. I know Spain was really into all that inquisition stuff back when, but it is sad to see that this vicious kind of violence still exists as entertainment in their culture.The story is about a 8-10 year old girl's plight. Her mother is a weak and foolish woman who after her husband dies decides to marry a sociopath and take her little innocent daughter who is still dealing with the death of her beloved father into this psycho's world.This monster is the captain of an outpost that stands against a group of rebels who are trying to change things. The captain runs the outpost like Dachau and tortures and murders anyone who even looks sideways at him.The girl's stupid mother is of course seduced by his darkness and power and gets herself pregnant with his son, his heir to evil.As we learn later, he could care less about the mother, and all she is to him is a piece of meat who's purpose is to allow him to propagate his evil.The death of the girl's father and that unresolved trauma combined with the horror of living in the hell her mother has lead her into causes the girl to create a fantasy world in her mind and a series of adventures that she undertakes.This is where the story gets very sad because you are aware that everything she is going through is in her mind, a fugue state brought on by the horror and emotional shock of all that has happened and is happening to her.By the end of the film pretty much everyone is dead, murdered, or tortured and there is no pay off, no hope.Despite what the fantasy sequence at the end may imply, it, in reality, is just a sad brutal end to an experience that no young child should ever be forced to endure. The guilt for the whole thing can be placed squarely at the door step of her stupid and selfish mother and her new sociopathic husband.I can not recommend this film except to those who like to see people get hurt and killed and enjoy a good nihilistic romp.",1181001600,"06 5, 2007"

"I've had a love/hate relationship with this movie ever since I first saw it in the theater as a kid.  It's one of those sequels that justifies the common assertion that sequels are always inferior to the ""originals"".  I do not expound that philosophy because, like the hypocrites that do, I have always bought a ticket to see sequels of favorite movies out of natural curiosity.Yes, ""Halloween II"" is not as good as the original.  Yes, it plays like a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel.  Yes, stuntman Dick Warlock (and all those who followed) is a poor replacement for Nick Castle and the grace he brought to the figure of Michael Myers.  Yes, the cast is populated with unappealing characters.  Yes, the death-by-boiling-her-head had already been done in Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"".  Yes, the Michael Myers mask is different (though I am weirdly fascinated by the varied masks in each of the sequels).  Yes, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shouts repeatedly that he shot Michael six times when in fact there are SEVEN gunshots at the beginning of the movie!  A neat trick for a revolver.We fans of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" couldn't help but yearn for a sequel.  The result could have been quite worse but it's unlikely that it could have been better.  Jamie Lee Curtis is to be commended for making the most out of this weak material while wearing a bad wig.  Donald Pleasence has always been fun but never more so than when his Dr. Loomis recites his Myers soliloquies as he stares off into space and the music comes up.  I love that!  Dr. Loomis' colleague (Nancy Stephens) returns as does Charles Cyphers as the sheriff and Nancy Loomis reprises her role... dead on a gurney!On a positive note, this is not one of those sequels that is so awful that watching it ruins one's appreciation for the original.  How's that for a recommendation?As for the blu-ray, it's fine, I guess (with the exception of the removal of ""Moustapha Akkad Presents"" from the opening credits).  But I would still like to know the whole story behind the rumored production woes and Carpenter's intervention.""Halloween III: Season of The Witch"", silly as it may be, is a more entertaining movie and I lament that it was not successful enough to spawn a series of annual Halloween movies with different stories instead of the same ol' generic slasher stuff above which the Michael Myers sequels could not rise.  I eagerly await the blu-ray release of ""Halloween III"".One final note, all the carnage Michael Myers inflicts upon his victims should be served up to the a**holes who rigged this blu-ray so that I have to sit through myriad previews and nonsense each time I stop it instead of returning to where I left off.",1319241600,"10 22, 2011"

The kidnap scene was great until they simply ran away on foot from the police with radios...on a freeway.

"""Three Days of the Condor"" came out around the time of the Watergate scandal, and sort of begins the genre of spy flicks in which the US Government represents the bad guys instead of the good guys.  The Watergate Era theme is hard to miss.  Other things about this flick are dated.  Redford holds an innocent woman prisoner in her own home, but its OK because hey, wouldn't most young women like to be held prisoner by Robert Redford?  Well, at least Robert Redford back in his prime.This film was kind of interesting when it first came out due to its negative portrayal of the CIA and US Government.  This kind of theme is now passe, and after seeing this film again after all these years, I have to say that this film is also somewhat passe.  The book (""Six Days of the Condor"" -- mercifully, they cut the days in half for the movie) was better, actually.  RJB.",1348358400,"09 23, 2012"

"A few years ago former Kweskin Jug Band vocalist, Maria Muldaur (remember her breakout single ""Midnight at the Oasis""?) turned out three tribute CDs paying honor to the great women blues singers. And all were terrific. Pop diva Cyndi Lauper is doing something similar here with the DVD/CD project. Recorded in a Memphis club in early 2011 - as a follow-up to her 2010 blues CD, Lauper held control over the project. You'll note that the DVD is subtitled ""A Film By Cyndi Lauper"". She called in some big names to add some power to her band - Allen Toussaint and Charlie Musslewhite - and holds her own on stage. The DVD contains some rehearsal footage and backstage banter and you can hear Lauper's well known squeaky (almost ""Betty Boop-line"") voice. But when she starts to sing she really does sound a lot like Muldaur. There's CD in the package too so you can just enjoy the music away from your TV.The camera work is first rate and the image on the Standard DVD was sharp and clear on my 32-year old TV!  While much of the show are blues numbers, Lauper includes a few of her pop hits - ""She Bop"" and the Robert Hazard-penned ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" - which some may feel are out of place but I enjoyed hearing in the ""Memphis clothes"".There are two ""bonus"" features as well. Both are studio performances of blues classics """"Wild Women Don't Have The Blues"" and ""Crossroads"".I wonder what genre the multi-faceted Lauper will explore next?I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",1332460800,"03 23, 2012"

"Delightfully French in every way, The Young Girls of Rochefort has a presence that makes up for the thin plotting and obvious preposterousness of much of the action and makes for a really rich and rewarding musical directed with visual flare by Jacques Demy.  Lavish sets, brilliant use of color (those costumes are to die for) and some of the best presentations of unified dance (no wonder Gene Kelly shows up), The Young Girls of Rochefort has enough going for it to completely pull you in.  The very opening number is splendid and sets the tone for this cooky yet breathtaking musical.Deneuve and Dorleac play twin sisters Delphine and Solange.  They live in Rochefort, France and are Paris bound, hoping to capitalize on their dreams and talent.  In the meantime, two carnies show up hoping to snag the sisters for an act, and woo them in the process.  Delphine is shaking off the advances of an older man, while Solange is flirting willfully with a man who may or may not be connected to her past, and then there is the strange foreigner, the painter in love with Delphine (but unaware of her actual existence) and the looming fear of a murderer.Seriously.All of this is vibrantly brought to life with song and dance and basically it all is preposterous and ridiculous and yet delicious and so much fun.  Piccoli and Darrieux are marvelous supporting players, and the film (which received a much deserved Oscar nomination in Original Screenplay) really should have swept the techs with wins for Cinematography, Art Direction and Costume Design.  Its just so beautiful to watch, and Demy douses every frame with style to spare!",1381708800,"10 14, 2013"

"Ugly, I felt like howling after a few minutes of watching this vomitous drivel. A waste of time. A tribute to decadence, and scum-sucking bottom feeders whose decline attracted the revulsion and rejection of high morals and the benefits of living with an high work ethic. Wanton rebellion has brought about the decline of American culture. The characters in this film evidenced selfishness and disillusion as a lifestyle, which became an attraction to narcissism and amorality. This era was a truly low-point in mankind. No evidence of appreciation for the greater society, but only a constant attack on it by losers.uIn their so-called creative investigations into humanity, they tossed all classical education, theology, and philosophy aside, and tried to emulate the socialist and communist losers of the 20's and 30's. Their revision and rejection of high culture was as welcome as a full ashtray.",1419465600,"12 25, 2014"
"Believe it or not I think there was actually a chance that this could have worked (outside of James Cameron returning). Although T3 wasn't the best, it stayed much closer to the Terminator formula than Salvation did. Instead of taking a vision of the future that was already created for us by the inventor of the franchise (as seen in Terminator 1, 2 & 3), Hollywood saw this as a chance make a big Michael Bay-eque action, explosion, robot, summer-tentpole movie with a few notable names.The first mistake they made was hiring one of the least competent filmmakers in all the world named simply 'McG'. The Mad Max style desert backdrop really pushed it further from making it feel like a true Terminator movie after seeing what it was supposed to be in the 3 previous movies. To top if off the casting of Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese (basically Christian Bale's father) really didn't make much sense. Michael Biehn was definitely NOT a teenager in the first movie when he went back to save Sarah Connor. Christian Bale really wasn't right for the part of John Connor (and he knows it) his infamous rant will always be attached to this movie and his name. And personally I didn't like the trendy casting of Common but that wasn't as big a deal.It's very difficult for a Terminator movie to be legitimized without Stan Winston's iconic affects. While Winston passed away before the movie was released the lack of his presence was felt and the apparent reliance on CG and digital effects were obvious. Some of the endoskeletons that we are used to seeing are in this movie (T-800) and some that we haven't seen before (T-600, T-700), that was actually kind of interesting, as well as the featuring of the Hunter Killers. However some of the new machines they tried to implement were just too Transformery (motorcycles really?).Finally the music (another trademark of the first 2 films) just wasn't strong enough. They chose Danny Elfman to essentially match Brad Fiedel (who basically retired from the biz in '95) and while he has done some fantastic music in his career he wasn't really the right guy for the job. The music should have been strong and able to stand on it's own like Fiedel's soundtrack for T2.It's hard for me to look at this in any other way because of the fact that it is a Terminator movie, there are certain standards it should meet and this fell far below those standards. Unfortunately there is no salvation in this Terminator movie but I'm sure they'll try again (Terminator Genisys).",1356480000,"12 26, 2012"

"I understand this is a shortened version to what we've seen in past versions, but right away there was wasted time with no dialogue running through the house.

The ladies all looked heavily made up. I much prefer try 1995 P&P's design of having the actresses not wear any make up, to more accurately portray women at the time.Sorry, but 1995's version is much superior.

Pete has a wooden leg, and will hire Meg's friend for help around the farm. Nate learns about the family history; Meg was adopted after her parents moved away. ""Don't take a short cut through the Oxhead woods!"" Avoid the Red House. The wind howls to provide an eerie sense. Or is it screams? The conversations provide the background to this story. Nate falls into the creek on the return home. Was it a human? Nate and Meg walk through the woods in the daylight. Pete orders Meg to stay out of the Oxhead woods. Pete doesn't want anyone trespassing in those woods!One day Meg sneaks out of her room to walk into the forbidden woods. She sees the Red House! Will she hear rifle shots? Why doesn't she return home? They call the doctor for Meg. Nate talks to her. Pete fires Nate and orders him off his land. Ellen reproaches Pete, and we learn the secret! Tibby has feelings for Teller. What is happening to Pete? Is the Red House haunting them? Ellen goes into the woods at night. Will she be safe? Pete tells what happened years ago. The police catch Teller. Pete drives to the Red House with Meg. Nate and the police arrive to rescue her. Pete drives into the building for the final scene.This slow paced film reminds me of a Val Lewton film. Its not scary and its not quite credible as a crime story. Would the sudden disappearance of a married couple go unnoticed? Friends or relatives would have asked questions. Who inherited their property [motive]?

"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is one of my favorite Batman Animated movie. This was the first Batman animated movie in the DCAU. In this movie, Batman must deal with a new villain known as the Phantasm, who is killing off some of Gotham City's biggest crime lords. The movie also reveals some details about Bruce's past when he had to make the biggest choice ever: to fight crime, or be with the woman he loves. This movie had some of the best voice acting in any of the movies. Voice actor's include Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Dana Delany as Andrea Beaumont (who goes on to later voice Lois Lane in Superman: The Animated Series). Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come included with any special features, but it's still a great movie nonetheless.

"This new set of Star Trek movies is much more than just a reboot as it serves as the prequel to the original Gene Roddenberry TV series that launched us into space in 1966. IMO the characters were perfectly cast for their older counter-parts and the story-line is great, with several twists and turns along the way. From the opening where Kirk (Chris Pine) defies the Prime Directive to the USS Enterprise chasing a bad guy to the Klingon world and an encounter with a super-advanced warship, Kirk, Spock (Zachary Quinto) & their crew are pushed to the absolute limits.

"I thought that this was going to be a funny Christmas movie with cute little furry creatures.That is how it starts out.But the cute little pet multiplies himself into evil little monsters called gremlins.There really is no plot - - a 20-something year old guy named Billy who still lives with his parents gets an unusual pet from his father for Christmas.  The sweet pet multiplies himself into hundreds of creatures who - - for no reason - - want to cause damage to everything they see and kill everyone they see, until Billy manages to kill them all at the end.There are ridiculous parts, like when Billy actually breaks a store window by banging it with a toddler's plastic toy.There are disgusting parts, like when one of the gremlins is cooked to death in a microwave.There are stupid parts, like where do these little creatures manage to get little outfits to wear - - one dresses up in a tiny trenchcoat and flashes people - - one dresses in a hat and sunglasses and smokes cigarettes and gets drunk - - they were just created and they already got wardrobes from nowhere.There are weird parts, like when Billy hangs out in his bedroom with a ten year old boy (Corey Feldman).This movie is very negative toward Christmas.  Phoebe Cates tells Billy a story about her father dressing up as Santa on Christmas Eve and dying horribly, which is how she realized that Santa is not real - - at the age of 9.  The only thing that made this a Christmas movie was that it takes place at Christmastime and there are Christmas decorations that get destroyed.I watched this whole movie because I just had to see how it would end.This movie was mostly disgusting, not at all scary, and too long.",1461628800,"04 26, 2016"
"The concept of this movie is great--a guy who always says no to everything is convinced to change his life he must say yes to everything. This could have been mined for great comedic laughs especially given Jim Carrey is the lead actor here. Sadly, the script is terrible. The worse is the last 20 minutes where it devolves into some sort of pining woe-is-me before, of course, the happy ending.The cast is pretty decent and deserved better. Having said that the lead actress Zooey (yep, that's her name) Deschanel is not very appealing. She plays a character with her own quirks but it's so low key you'd think she's comatose at times. She also is very unbelievable when she tries for angry in a scene.No extras at all on this version of the DVD and, frankly, if you do make it through this movie without fast-forwarding any of it, Warner Bros. should give you a medal or something.",1314835200,"09 1, 2011"
"There are heroes and there are superheroes, and then there's Hancock, played by Will Smith. He's a superhero who's edgy, sarcastic and misunderstood - with a healthy drinking problem. His heroics get the job done, but leave incredible amounts of damage in its wake - the people of Los Angeles aren't happy with him and razz and boo him, adding to his sense of isolation. Jason Bateman plays an idealistic ad exec who wants to champion Hancock's cause after being saved himself. Jason's wife is Charlize Theron who has superpowers herself she is trying to keep under wraps. Despite some fun visuals and a few laughs, this movie is only so-so, and really doesn't succeed. The movie wasn't very well framed: the beginning wants to be a comedy and the end has some very dark scenes - too dark I feel for what's gone before. The characters are very thinly drawn, especially when Theron's character is suddenly flinging Will about with an anger that is as yet unexplained, the explanation being rather flimsy when it does come. The plot is rather thin as well and we don't really care much about any of the characters: Hancock himself was the most sympathetic, and there wasn't really enough there to make us care all that much, though you wanted to. It was a neat concept, however, and there were some genuine laughs in the beginning, so I'll give it an extra star - though if you rent or buy it, I think you'll have a better experience if you stop watching about halfway through.",1223856000,"10 13, 2008"

"We've come to a place in the genre of the Spaghetti Western, which was essentially created by Sergio Leone in 1964 with 'Fistful of Dollars', where the movies are starting to get a little more comical and silly. Even Ennio Morricone's score seems much more playful than his previous in the Dollars trilogy, not to mention that part of it was recycled from Once Upon a Time in the West. It seems Leone's name was only attached to this project as a favor to Tonino Valerii, who was the films official director.The continual reference to 'The Wild Bunch' and even a grave marked 'Sam Peckinpah' (the director of The Wild Bunch) seems like too obvious a nod to the classic American Western. The protagonist of the film (Nobody) is definitely no Clint Eastwood, instead Terence Hill's character thrives much more on goofy antics and seemingly unreasonable feats (who in the world could possibly drink that much whiskey and stay standing?).The casting of Henry Fonda, who was pretty late in his career at this point, was an apparent attempt to re-create the chemistry he added to ...in the West. If you love or are really interested in Spaghetti Westerns, this might be worth a watch, but overall it really isn't strong enough to stand with the greats in the sub-genre.",1397606400,"04 16, 2014"
"There really ought to be a law against screenwriters who suck the life out of literary characters. If there were, the culprits behind the screenplay for ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" would be languishing in the deepest, foulest crud-filled dungeon holes imaginable. Helen Fielding, one of the three screenwriters, must have been held captive and tortured. Only that would explain her participation in this literary travesty.To have transformed Bridgett's mother -- narcissistic, flighty and imperturbable - into a weepy, sad little housewife is incomprehensible, never mind unforgivable. To give Daniel Cleaver - unrepentant rogue and scoundrel - any hint of sympathy is idiotic and wrong. To add a fight scene - complete with a plunge through a plate glass window! - is positively imbecilic. This is London, sod it, not the bloody Wild West!And poor Bridget, denuded of her obsessive charm, her wry perceptiveness and her fascination with pop culture...shocking!The result is a bleached out, watered down and thoroughly stomach-churning translation of a cast of funny, silly and thoroughly contemporary characters into the blandest and most tepid of leftover puddings.There's only one remedy: READ THE BOOK!",1120867200,"07 9, 2005"

"I loved this series and watched it all on TV. It aired from 1988-1991. Was pleased to see it had been released on DVD. The shows were excellent  good characters, good writing, and good acting, and a deft mix of drama, action, and quirky humor. The horrors of war and the emotional damage of PTS are relevant today.

The base provides triage and emergency surgery for wounded American soldiers flown in from the field, with a parallel operation to entertain soldiers recovering or taking R&R. Both Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger won Emmys for their roles. My only complaint was that during the last two seasons, the mix of current action with flashbacks or flash forwards, while fleshing out the characters, sometimes became confusing and may have been part of the reason the shows ratings never reflected its quality.",1437264000,"07 19, 2015"

Was great to meet more of the other families and friends too.  Great job with David Gabriel's storyline.  And the guest stars were amazing this season.

"Many years ago there was a classical radio show in New York which began late at night. It was not unusal for the host who clearly had discretion over the contents of his program, to play a version of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze di Figaro) once or more a week and occassionally twice in an evening.Yes: I too love the music and there are many many good, great and othervise versions available on CD and otherwise.The DVD reviewed here is a recorded version of a production from the Metropolitan Opera of a few years ago with a performance conducted by James Levine and a solid Met Opera cast.There is no issue if that is of your mind: you love the opera; you love watching it; you go for traditional productions and costuming; etc. Fine: this is for you.For those of us that find watching the somewhat dated plot played out, this production adds little that listening to a great recording does not already provide plus that added advantage of no feeling that one must actually be glued to a seat.Recommended with these qualifications.",1372636800,"07 1, 2013"

Didn't appreciate the Archibishop of Canterbury's butt scene--nor the ""Jesus is coming soon, etc.,"" on the rear of an earlier butt. Toilet humor really isn't funny...nor were most of the scenarios in this movie. It's really more like those B action movies the cable networks put on late at night for people suffering from insomnia.

"Boy, what a frustrating film to watch....even though it is very good and has been a part of my collection for a number of years now. Still, it's hard to see the good guy, the little guy, beaten up by the big guys. Here's one story where Goliath beats David.Anyway, this was an interesting supposedly- true-life story of how Preston Tucker got a raw deal form the Big Three car-makers of the day, and by the government after he built a much better automobile in 1948. The film details how the big boys made sure Tucker's company never sold any of those cars.Jeff Bridges does a solid job of portraying Tucker, an upbeat, positive-thinking inventor. It also was refreshing to see a nice, supportive family, too. I enjoyed all the main actors in this film: Bridges, Joan Alen, Martin Landau, Frederic Forest, Elias Koteas and Christian SlaterThe 1940s atmosphere in this film is very good and the old music is fun to hear, too. The cinematography is great, too, with some tinted vintage-type color at times. It looks wonderful on DVD.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007"
"My used VHS copy of ""Paranoid"" made an immediate bad impression. It is a bad sign when you pick up a used VHS and find that it has ""not"" been rewound from a point midway into the movie. There is a very good chance that the last viewer got so disgusted by that point that they just bailed out and traded the thing in without even bothering to fast forward to the ending. Bad impression #2 came when I discovered the poor audio quality and tried to activate the subtitles-the tape does not have this feature (nor does the DVD version). Subtitles are added between  the final cut and distribution. They represent a modest additional expense so when they are missing from post-1996 movies it is because the producers were so unimpressed with the final product that they were already trying to cut their losses.That said ""Paranoid"" is not as bad as most commentary would lead you to believe. This is a psychological thriller that borrows heavily from ""Rear Window"" and ""The Collector"". Unfortunately, the generally decent cast is hampered by the limited talents of Jessica Alba, who not only looks the part of a fashion model, but exhibits the expected thespian skills of most fashion models.Although the distributors promote the movie as if the title refers to Chloe's (Alba) mindset, it actually is a reference to main captor Stan's (Iain Glen) delusions. These pass for irony as his damage control measures transform a minor and easily concealed crime into a high stakes situation. Although we are told at one point that Stan's last name is Kowalski and wait patiently for him to scream ""Stella"", director John Duigan somehow resists the temptation to go there.The just-under-the-surface depravity of the household is masked by the presence of a deaf child, nicely played by Mischa Barton. Barton gives a subtle non-verbal performance as the movie's only totally sympathetic character. Unfortunately, Duigan's script does not explore her motivations or how she has remained uncorrupted despite growing up in this environment. Instead the character is just an ethereal presence, helping to advance the story line but too distanced to really connect with the audience. Interestingly, when her parents ""sign"" to her they also say the words. Given the poor audio quality and inaudible dialogue it would have been useful for all the characters to ""sign"" their lines (after a few minutes of ""Paranoid's"" audio everyone can relate better to a deaf child).Also helping to advance the story line is Kevin Whately who plays the Jimmy Stewart ""Rear Window"" character. He perfectly plays a voyeur who is the only one who genuinely cares for Chloe's wellbeing. He cares enough to risk exposure in order to save her. But in attempting to illustrate his binocular observations of Chloe's apartment the folks in post-production not only added the silly black circles around the binocular image but desaturated all the color from these views-duh!Duigan is such a poor storyteller and his direction so laid back that he does generate any tension or suspense. But ""Paranoid"" is more tiring than boring, as you have to stay focused and work hard just to decipher what is happening in each scene (not because it is complicated but because it is so poorly illustrated). There are simply too many characters here and they are too unconventional, Duigan does not come close to giving us even one fully developed character. A good director would have used behaviors to complement dialogue but Duigan is too focused on style to provide any substance.The movie has good production design style and a fair number of nice visual moments. Like the unexpected and very sudden change in Chloe's situation when Stan slips the handcuffs on her wrist. And later when Gordon (Ewen Bremer) seemingly brings a tray of toast to the handcuffed Chloe and then casually eats it himself without even offering it to her.Even if you can follow what is supposed to be the final twist (Chloe's photographer boyfriend is the obsessive phone caller but Duigan's slips this revelation in so poorly that few will comprehend what he is showing), you just don't care because there so little character development or foreshadowing that it has no emotional impact.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1128470400,"10 5, 2005"

"It's hard to imagine a bigger waste of my time than Blue Jasmine. I mean to get only 1 star it really has to be an absolute disaster.  It is.  When much of the movie accomplishes nothing at all with no storyline whatsoever, yeah, it's awful.  Blue Jasmine fits that type of movie.  It's about Cate Blanchett who moves to San Francisco and specifically with her sister Sally Hawkins, and while there Cate has to deal with her sisters obnoxious, drunk, uncaring boyfriend (Andrew Dice Clay's character- and it's LAUGHABLE how tame he is in this film considering what his stand-up routine is like, and even funnier than he's totally out of place in a romantic comedy like this).  Cate has other issues.She hates working in a dentist's office because she has to set appointment dates for people that often leads to confusion and annoyances for Cate because they suddenly change their times and schedules.  Well Cate that's life. That's part of the job.  It happens all the time.  And her boss likes to hit on Cate in hyperactive, unusual fashion (played by Michael Stuhlbarg).  These are probably the high parts of the movie.  At least they feel like they're attempting to take the storyline in an interesting direction.  They don't unfortunately, but at least these moments *try* to.  Alec Baldwin fans I have some bad news too- he's a typical pretty boy that says very little once again, a role he's comfortable playing in movies and TV shows (and commercials) as of late.  He could easily be emitted from the film without nobody noticing.  Hard to believe given how popular he is, but his character is just wasteful.To give a surprising compliment, this movie has really phenomenal acting believe it or not.  It's the really really REALLY uninteresting/unproductive storyline that basically shows Cate complaining and feeling miserable with a phony high class snotty attitude even when she should be portrayed as normal that hurts this movie a lot.  It's the ""who's cheating with who"" shenanigans and ""who's kissing who"" stuff that makes up a huge chunk of the storyline that really rubs me the wrong way, and honestly anyone who appreciates how amazing storytelling in movies can be and how gripping you can feel when the story is compelling enough should hate a movie like Blue Jasmine as well.  This isn't even for chicks.  It's for background noise when you don't feel like watching anything else.",1431561600,"05 14, 2015"

The story is about the bond of their friendship and their fight to save the world. There are a lot of things about this anime to like. The animation is really good, the voice acting is good and the characters are interesting. Each episode keeps you wanting to keep watching more. As the relationships between the characters grows stronger the show becomes more captivating. I haven't watched the DVD version, but the Blu-ray version is good; not the best Blu-ray quality I've seen; but the picture is clear and the colors are vivid. The worst part about the show is that I have to wait to see the 2nd season. I really liked Shakugan no Shana and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.

"OK, its not about a knee-jerk negative reaction to remakes in general. Remakes of classics such as The Thing, The Blob, The Fly, and the super-potent TCM remake, all succeeded with flying colors because they brought fresh ideas and technical expertise to classics that we all love. Not so here. This is no more of a Zombie movie than the horrid 28 Days Later. One thing horror should never be is a crashing bore. What is with all those MTV style quick cuts. You never really see anything, which is just as well, I guess. What you do see looks like hell thanks to the insipid computer effects.

"To non-fans of Star Trek,there is the""odd numbered film curse"",which odd numbered Trek film come off as disappointing. Usually the problem is second guessing fan expectation,& thinking big budget  means big box office(i.e Trek 1 & 5).When I read about the upcoming  ST9,I noticed that the budget was more than the average box office take of  the other films(I sense a disappointing gross).Overall Insurrection was a  better movie than most of the Oddies(except 3).It had some very funny  moments,and Patrick Stewart seemed to be having fun as Picard. But one can't  help but feel its story would've been better suited on TV.And considering  the great quality of DS9 episodes with the Dominion war,you also feel the  writers would strive for more on the big screen. As i expected the Box  office tally was lower than expected(D'UH),but ST10 was announced ,so Trek  films will continue and avoid straight-to-video oblivion.

Who carries a dozen five-gallon jugs full of water on a heavily-loaded cargo flight OUT of the desert, to Beijing?  The endless parade of mishaps don't inspire dread, they inspire wonder that any of these people can make a living at their jobs.

"By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, ""Success"" can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50.  No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in ""Jerry Maguire,"" the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really?  Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding ""No.""  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a ""mission/morality statement,"" in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed. In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic.  It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big ""M"" his superiors are interested in turns out to be ""Money"" and not ""Morality,"" as in ""Money talks, Jerry walks.""  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the ""real"" Jerry Maguire. Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with ""Say Anything"" in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In ""Jerry Maguire"" he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life. Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he ""Show me the money!"" Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen. Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd.  She's such a ""giving"" actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film. The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",1010966400,"01 14, 2002"

"I've always loved sword-and-sandal flicks, so last night I rented a copy of Jason and the Argonauts hoping for some mythological mayhem.  What I  ended up with was a poorly-paced and tedious bowdlerized waste of video.  The acting is terrible.  The worst of all is Dennis Hopper's role as  Pelias.  Sometimes, acting is so bad it's funny.  In Dennis Hopper's case,  the acting is so bad it is not funny at all--it's just plain awful.  I  think he could have done a better job if he'd been reading lines off a  teleprompter.Another problem I have is with the casting for the part of  Jason, played by Jason London.  He is referred to as having a handsome face  and being a hero throughout the movie, but this is a case of wishful  thinking.  Although Jason London is not an ugly man, he is decidedly plain.  And his appearance certainly doesn't inspire paeans of heroism, either.  He's rather spindly, and, to top it all off, he sports a mullet!The  bowdlerization is quite annoying.  Someone castrated a perfectly-good tale  for the sake of a PG-rating.  Where is the blood, gore, and sexual tension  of the original story?  It's certainly not in this waste of a miniseries.  According to legend, Medea is a frightening, cold-blooded, black witch.  Although she does fall in love with Jason, her love is marred by obsession  and cruelty.  In order to help Jason make his grand escape from Colchis,  she slows down her father's pursuit by murdering her brother (still a child  in the myth, and not the hale and hearty admiral of the video), rending him  into small pieces, and throwing the bits overboard from the Argo.  The  father, in his grief, slows his fleet to gather up the body parts of his  beloved son.  In the movie, Medea is portrayed as selfless and good, hardly  the sort of woman she ended up being in legend when she tortures the  philandering Jason's new wife and father-in-law to death and murders her  own children.Another problem is the treatment of Hercules.  Although I  almost smiled at his braggadocio regarding the twelve tasks he had earlier  completed, the joke soon became old.  What is lacking are his prodigious  amorous achievements.  This is hinted at chastely in the matriarchy of  Lemnos when he sits in a pool surrounded by a bevy of gorgeous women, but  the real reason he disappeared from the Argonauts isn't even hinted at:  the handsome young Argonaut Hylas went missing at Cios.  Hercules was  passionately in love with this boy, and chose to stay behind to find him.  I don't know why the Lemnians are portrayed so negatively.  According to  legend, the Argonauts stayed there for a year and had a whole nursery-load  of children with these women.  There are plenty of scary adventures in the  mythos which aren't even touched on.  I guess this scene of Amazons, er,  Lemnians, is included for titillation.The only thing that saves this  movie from being an utter disaster are some of the special effects.  The  harpies of King Phineus are imaginatively done, if more bloodthirsty than  legend has it. Instead of killing whoever eats, they instead stole the food  and defecated on what was left.  I guess this is just a little too  scatological for modern-day audiences.  Ah well.  As I was saying, the  harpies are wonderfully-done and are formidable enemies.  Similarly, the  taming of the fire-breathing bull (only one, opposed to the two in legend),  is done rather well.  It's too bad the rest of the movie doesn't measure up  to these fine scenes.",966556800,"08 18, 2000"
"I enjoyed the first one far more than this one, primarily because the storyline was simple without any real surprises. The fight scenes were also difficult to follow because of excessive camera movement. I think the effort here was to make Neeson appear faster than he really is.

"Not all bellydance DVDs are workouts, some are just designed to teach the art of dancing with a workout being secondary. Bellyqueen: Bellydance Jam falls into this category. Not purely traditional, the title and front cover of the DVD alone should give away the modern bent on bellydance. This one is designed for the younger generation and or those completely new to bellydance who don't foresee themselves as the next headlining act at the local Mediterranean restaurant but are still interested in learning how to dance better for parties, club, and the like. Bellydancing is the epitome of feminine movement; it's no small wonder that learning some simple bellydance moves with styling tailored for the modern girl is a great way to learn how to club dance. Teaching bellydance moves appropriate for the club floor is the focus of this DVD.Where this DVD really excels is in the teaching. Amar Gamal of Bellydance Superstars' fame and her Bellyqueen partner Kaeshi Chai, a member of The Desert Roses, are excellent teachers for dancers so young. Moves are all shown full body and if needed, from multiple angles. Instructions are voiceover style and lots of pointers abound on what muscles to relax, what body parts to isolate, and sometimes even when to breathe. All dance descriptions go much further than ""just lift your hip and drop it."" They have one of the best descriptions of the Camel, an undulation move, that is difficult to teach women whose learning style doesn't fall along the lines of `monkey-see, monkey-do.' The clear and concise description of this move as well as several others, a backward moving horizontal figure 8, for example, are clear enough that even an absolute beginner to all forms of dance could eventually get with some practice. If you've had trouble with other DVDs in the past not being clear enough for you to `get' the moves, this is the one for you.The section on ""How to Improvise"" in the Improvisation section is absolutely priceless for both the newbee and the intermediate dancer. This is a topic rarely covered by instructors in any form of dance. You'll learn how to listen to the music and then choose which moves will appropriately fit the song. The knowledge you'll gain here is transferrable to all forms of dance. In ""Partner Combinations"" Amar and Kaeshi teach you how to dance with a partner in  much more dynamic and interesting ways than the basic routine they provide in the instruction. ""Guided Improvisation"" also gives you the chance to practice.Those of us who have been dancing for a while will probably be a bit disappointed at the length of the DVD. 115 minutes sounds long but consists of a 37 minute technique section with only 25 minutes devoted to instruction, 5 minutes of guided stretching and loosening (which happens to be excellent), 3 minutes devoted to practicing the ""BQ Boogie"" -- a dance routine best described as a cute, belly flavored version of the electric slide, and a 3 minute cool down stretch (again this one is excellent.) Other than 10 minutes devoted to learning to improvise, the rest of the DVD is bonus material. However, the included 12 track CD is alone worth the purchase price of the DVD. Twelve groovy belly tunes by Mission to Mars (Vin Scialla) and Turbo Tabla -- the classically trained Karim Nagi, provide the Arabic House soundtrack. Some fun and excellent stuff is found here -- some of it exclusive to this DVD. In the Special Features section, each girl has a solo bellydance performance in traditional costume. ""Call of The Drum with Mal Stein"" is a Drum Solo Performance By Amar Gamal, and ""Dunyavi Gypsy Passion"" is a solo performance by Kaeshi Chai in a Folk or ""Gypsy"" style. There are two video montages -- ""Bellyqueen Around The World"" is of Bellyqueen performances and ""Bellydance Superstars"" is the Bellydance Superstars promo montage you've probably seen before if you own any other Bellydance Superstars DVD. The rest is interviews with the dancers and musicians from this DVD. All of this is available in English or Espanol on the same disc. The Spanish translation is accessible from the Main Menu and includes Instruction, Menus, and Bonus Material.*Foundation moves taught on disc:Shoulder Circles, Vogue Arms, Shoulder Thrust, Shoulder Shimmies, Chest Lift and Drop, V-Pop (Chest Lift and Drops in a ""V"" Shape), V-Strut (V-Pops while walking forward and backward), Hip Twist, Inward Figure 8, Hip Shimmies, Contraction and Release, Omi (Small Hip Circle), Medium Hip Circle, Chest Circle, Undulation -Upper Torso (Chest), Undulation - Lower Torso (Pelvis), Undulation - Whole Body, Hip Lock, Hip Lift and Drop, Walk to Side, 3-Point Turn*Transition Steps:Hip March, Step Touch*Partner Combinations:Mirroring, Synchronized Call and Answer, Opposites, See-Saw, Back and Forth*Improvisation Section (Freestyle)Lean how to: Listen to the Music, Dance to the Beat, Dance to the Melody, Dance to the Accents, Dance to a combination of the Beat, Melody, and Accents, Add variety by changing the movements: Circles, Undulations, Shimmies, Change LevelsBonus Bellyqueen Music CD Track Listing:1.

"ABOUT A BOY, based on Nick Hornby's 1998 hit novel, showcases a Hugh Grant veering away from his more normal role of hapless, stuttering romantic lead and, instead, this time, playing a shallow, emotionally stunted cad. Hugh Grant is so good in this role that it doesn't take long before you find yourself being charmed by this ingratiating, witty, and rudderless no-goodnik. Equally solid is the youngster Nicholas Hoult, who makes his film debut here. The not-quite-father-and-son (more like older-and-younger-brothers) rapport between Grant and Hoult, as well as a storyline which doesn't pander to the audience, makes this movie really work.SPOILERS here: This movie is about a boy...and a man who acts like a boy. Will Lightman (Hugh Grant) is a 38 year old bachelor whose songwriting father once wrote a famous Christmas jingle, of which royalties Will is still cheerfully living on. Will has never worked in his life and uses his credo ""all men are islands"" to explain the lonely emptiness and aimlessness in his life. He spends all his time ensuring that his life is so compartmentalized that he has activities broken down into units of time (taking a bath: 1 unit, exercising: 3 units, having his hair carefully dis-shelved: 4 units, etc.). He's so irresponsible that when a friend invites him to become her baby girl's godfather, the aghast Will rejects the offer. His friend retorts in disbelief, ""I thought you had hidden depths,"" to which Will responds with a clarifying ""No, no, no, no...no. You always had that wrong. I really am this shallow."" The other lead character is Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), an odd 12-year-old boy who's a misfit in school and who's constantly worried about his unstable mother (Toni Collette). Marcus is so off-the-wall that even his nerdy chums cast him off as being too weird.When Will turns his lasvicious eyes on single mothers, he discovers the SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) support group. He joins a session and actually bags a picnic date with single mom Susie. However, on the day which will forever be known as the Dead Duck Day (oh, that poor duck!), Will is horrified to find out that the picnic will have added company in the form of  Marcus, whom Susie takes care of on occasion. The rest of the film depicts the relationship between Marcus and Will as, in due course, Marcus teaches Will to become more responsible and caring, and Will, in return, gives Marcus self-confidence and helps him to fit in better with his peers as Will becomes the go-to adult anchor in the boy's life. In the end, Will discovers that, instead of being a mere island, a chain of islands is infinitely more satisfying.The story is great, obviously. Chris and Paul Weitz, who had earlier helmed AMERICAN PIE, would, at first, seem to be poor choices to be directing this higher brow effort, but, apparently, they were big fans of the book and managed to convince the right people. They do a massively good job here, conducting a delicate juggling act of comedy, pathos, and cynicism. The secret of this movie, of course, is that it contains a core of misery. The socially awkward Marcus is sadly unable to be a regular kid and is thus ridiculed by his peers. His mom is definitely ""off colored"" and is prone to fits of depression. And Will. The saddest thing may be that, for a great length of film time, he continues to endorse his solitary and meaningless way of life. When he does come around, finally, there's a feeling that he does it somewhat reluctantly. The bits of humor thrown into the mix perfectly balances out the picture and even works to bolster the pathos and make the cynicism seem less cruel.The cast is excellent. And a very well done to Hugh Grant, who has matured to the point where I feel he's become a real thespian, instead of this clever bloke with a cute blinking gimmick and nice hair. And, of course, I continue to savor his urbane, uniquely British wit. His predominant on-screen partner, newcomer Nicholas Hoult, plays off him really well and they have nice moments that are quirky without being too syrupy. The best thing about Nicholas is that he didn't play his Marcus as confused but sweet. There were actually moments where I thought the kid was being too pushy or obtuse. I could see why other kids would bully him - Marcus is more than a bit off-kiltered. Still, you do end up rooting for him to do well. Toni Collette, as usual, convincingly makes her presence felt as Marcus's troubled mom as there were points in the film where I thought, ""Uh-oh, she really is gonna off herself."" More screen time for the ravishing Rachel Weisz would've been preferred, but I do understand that this film is about Will and Marcus and not Will and Rachel, so it's all good.Special Features include: ""Spotlight on Location"": the 11-minute Making of ABOUT A BOY; feature commentary by Directors Chris and Paul Weitz; deleted scenes (with optional directors' commentary); music videos by Badly Drawn Boy (including the awesome ""Something to Talk About""; lyrics to ""Santa's Super Sleigh""; English to English dictionary; production notes; cast & crew bios; and the movie trailer.As someone in the special features mentioned, this film is an intelligent blend of cynicism and hope. Nick Hornby's depiction of bachelorhood in England is well represented here as the directors strived mightily to be faithful in their adaptation, though, apparently, they did come up with new stuff for the end bits. So, yes, do try this one out. ABOUT A BOY is thoughtful, a bit prickly, funny, and not at all mawkish,and, because the film doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, it'll stay in your brain and in your heart just that much longer.

"The film opens on an English textile mill that is up for sale. It uses man-made fibers. A device attracts attention by management. Who authorized it? At what cost? A graduate from Cambridge was experimenting and discovered what the result was. The scenes show life in the 1940s. The monetary figures date this story. One firm bought an electronic microscope and needs Mr. Stratton's help. [No employee badges then.] There is a romance between Daphne Birnley, the millionaire mill owner's daughter, and the owner of that small mill. Stratton has an idea for the polymerization of molecules to develop a long chain that will revolutionize the textile industry. Will it have unintended consequences? Sidney Stratton goes to see Mr. Birnley. There is comedy in the interaction of people who don't understand each other. But the mill owner wants to beat the competition.What if they could produce a fiber that lasted forever and repelled dirt? How would it benefit mankind? But would people get tired of the same old thing? Evil Sir John complains about this new cloth. The mill owners and the workers have their doubts. The mill owners will use force and violence to get what they want; science be damned. News of this everlasting thread causes stocks to fall. Will a rich man pimp his daughter to do business? Do they let morals stand in the way of profits? Does human nature upset the best-laid plans? Can labor and management unite to protect their interests? [What about the customer's needs and wants?] There is a comic chase that echoes the horror movies where the people chase the monster that threatened their well-being. Can scientists just leave things alone? There is a happy ending when things don't work as expected.",1216684800,"07 22, 2008"

"You can't keep a good horror villain down, so it doesn't come as a surprise that ghoulish vampire Radu's death lasts about.... oh, five and a half minutes.Sadly, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't quite live up to the standards of its colorful B-movie predecessor. Oh, it's still got plenty of gooey blood, skeletons and Radu being hilariously awesome, but the main characters seem to have been badly wussified. And the introduction of Radu's ""mummy"" (who even looks like one) just doesn't add anything to the movie.When the ""subspecies"" creatures reattach Radu's head, he returns to life and immediately kills Stefan. Michelle (Denise Duff) barely manages to escape his castle with the Bloodstone (which has somehow morphed into a white stone in a claw) and runs away to the nearest city. She pleads with her sister Becky to come get her, then immediately ends up on a wild trip through the city's nightside.Meanwhile, Radu has decided that he sorta kinda likes Michelle, so he asks his ""mummy"" to help him take back the Bloodstone and make Michelle his plaything. Yes, the evil vampire is asking his mommy to help him. Meanwhile, Becky (Melanie Shatner, daughter of William) arrives in Romania and tries to figure out what is going on with her sister, and discovers the horrifying truth of what Michelle is enmeshed in.Even though it takes place only minutes after the last movie, ""Subspecies II"" doesn't work quite as well. The major reason is that both Michelle and Radu are drastically wussified - Michelle spends most of the story whining, crying and throwing up, and Radu starts running to his desiccated mother for help.Additionally, a good one-third of the story is just Michelle running around the city, crying, whining and donning increasingly gothic clothing. However, the other two-thirds are actually quite solid, especially since it alternates between the day and night sides of the city. It hasn't quite got the flavor of the original, but the inclusion of club-gothic and Victorian gothic is a nice touch.And the climax is pretty deliciously ""Subspecies"" -- we have gooey blood, repeated stabbings, and someone being set on fire. So basically, it's lots of fun.Shatner gives a fairly decent performance as a strong, businesslike young woman who is having to grapple with the news that vampires not only exist, but that her sister is one. Kevin Spirtas is more of an annoyance than an actual character, and Michael Denish makes a decent Van Helsing for most of the movie. And... well, I'm not sure if Pamela Gordon actually plays ""Mummy,"" or if she just voiced a blind dried-up mummy that someone dragged out of an Incan grave.It's not quite as good as the first one, but ""Subspecies II"" is a decent sequel with a nice new lead character and some delicious atmosphere. So now, on to ""Subspecies III.""",1364601600,"03 30, 2013"
"It's a hard act following a classic series of movies from the old days so while I felt the character interactions and special effects were especially well done I found myself lacking in story plotting and overall resonance. So regarding the former two elements it's very spot on as we have a tight relationship between the main human character (James Franco) and the CGI created chimpanzee (voiced by Andy Serkis a la Gollum), Caesar, who will become the founder of an intelligent race of apes that dominate the globe in later years but unless you know of the Planet of the Apes universe (POA) then disregard that last part.John Lithgow is the father of the main character scientist and he's got Alzheimer's which explains why Franco's character is so hell bent on finding a cure. He works at a secretive company that is experimenting on apes to try and find a cure. Of course some of the apes are treated cruelly and disregarded. One mother dies during birth and Franco's character finds himself reluctantly taking care of the baby chimp and then growing emotionally attached to it. Those emotional connections are some of the best parts of this picture as you begin to see the species division arise as Caesar sees his kind as pets/slaves to humanity and gradually rebels. Up until the climax I thought it was plotted very well but the whole fight was poorly delivered. I personally felt that a more powerful counter force would have been sent out to deal with the ape problem at the end but I won't get into big time spoilers. There was also another big question at the end which wasn't answered to my satisfaction either. In fact up until the climax this was like a B plus to A minus film.This film was nominated by the 2012 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects. For POA fans who know it all this was intended as a prequel to ""The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"". The screenwriters put several moments into the films that are nods to the old pictures so look for them.The budget for this picture was $93M and it made over $481M at the Box Office (Wiki).STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: A minus to A; ACTION: B minus to B; THEME FOCUSES & DELIVERY: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012.",1337299200,"05 18, 2012"

"CONTAINS SPOILERSThe Inside, AKA ""Stupid Obnoxious People Taking Way Too Long To Die"" is the first Irish horror movie I have not liked. No, let me rephrase that- it is the first I have hated. Not much really going on, so every scene is drrraaaawwwn out way too long. The exploitation has no impact, partly because you do not care about any of the characters, and part because it takes just a few seconds to know exactly how everything will play out. No suspense, no fear, just boredom. The writer tries to make a home break-in and torture movie suddenly become some sort of demonic monster movie, and it fails miserably. Okay- they are kidnapped, they are assaulted, now there are some runes painted on a wall. Wow, I sure am scared. As in every bad horror film, nobody grabs weapons, all characters either freeze or panic- in this case they CONSTANTLY make crying or screaming noises at all times, even when stealth could save their life- they make stupid decision after stupid decision after stupid decision. The funniest scene was when a boyfriend has a weapon (early on in movie) and he drops it because the three rapists promise him nobody will be hurt if he complies. Then (of course) he is beaten to a pulp and apparently he was full of raspberry jelly the whole time (kudos for using tasty condiments in place of fake blood). Someone gets away, for no reason drops the camera (which is her only evidence), a guy walking by picks it up, does not turn it in to anyone who could help, but retraces their steps and attempts to rescue a female or two with no assistance and despite all he has seen on the camera. The end is as inexcusable as the rest of this mess; a person who is comatose most of the movie suddenly lashes out at the person who is obviously there to help, striking him with a rock in the head; she escapes, and I guess he is dead. Seen this same nonsensical stupidity far too many times in bad horror, and it is just keeps getting worse every time a lazy writer uses this trope. Watch this movie if you like lots of film padding, very poor writing, and seeing things you have seen before many, many times in far better films.",1431820800,"05 17, 2015"
The best part of this video is that Cheryl and Maks project their voices very well.  They make it easy to follow the moves.  However I have a carpeted home and doing these moves on a carpet does't work well. I even tried barefeet but that didn't work either. You need an uncarpeted area to really formulate the moves. These are a good workout but you need to have the right floor in your home. If I had a nice dance studio that would be perfect but I don't.  That is my biggest disappointment is that I just can't do them in any room of my home - which was the whole idea of getting the DVD!,1248393600,"07 24, 2009"

"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Last Witch Hunter""1. This is what I call a WYSIWYG movie - What You See Is What You Get. The trailer gave a pretty accurate idea of what to expect.2. It's the latest in the long line of 'immortal hunter' genre movies, like ""Blade""and ""Underworld"". In this one, witches live hidden among us regular humans. Vin Diesel is an immortal human, haunted by his past, who hunts down renegade witches that want to end the truce with humans and start a war. Blah blah blah.3. The movie doesn't spend much energy on making an original or smart story - it's the same thing we've seen over and over.4. Where the movie succeeds is the visuals. It's shot well and the computer effects are pretty impressive.5. Elijah Wood plays Vin Diesels's sidekick, a nerdy priest in New York City. I really like Elijah, but this movie was a step down for his career. I'm confused as to why he decided to make this movie.6. The movie was directed by Breck Eisner. His last film was the pretty decent remake of ""The Crazies"". But Eisner also directed ""Sahara"", one of the biggest financial disasters in Hollywood history.7. Parts of the movie look and feel like a video game.8. This movie is aimed at super geeks and teenagers, so if you can relate to one of those groups, you'll enjoy it well enough. Besides, you can't hate a movie that has flaming swords, underground witch clubs, and gummy bear trees.9. This is not a bad movie. But it's also not a good movie. It's not a waste of time, but it's also not one that you will remember for long.",1448409600,"11 25, 2015"

Hoffman's performance especially towards the end of the film is amazing and is this film's only redeming quality in my opinion.

"A movie of this title starring Ben Stiller is bound to be hit, or at least worth its weight in laughs.  So when I saw this film, I was not disappointed, yet I found the visual aspects of a few over-the-top sex scenes rather raunchy and certainly not necessary for the humor this crazed plot and Stiller's comic appeal readily provided.Tired of getting teased for his bachelorhood, Eddie Cantrow was quick to fall for the first pretty damsel in distress he befriended on a city street.  With the urging of Stiller's real-life and on-screen dad, this leading character marries who he believes to be the girl of his dreams. Two minutes into his honeymoon, he begins to have second thoughts that keep escalating until he realizes he's in his worst nightmare and not about to wake up anytime soon.The only comforting part of this bad dream is the presence of Miranda, another woman on vacation with her family at the same resort where Eddie is honeymooning.  Afraid of losing Miranda and equally fearful of hurting his wife, it is easy for the viewer to sympathize with Stiller's character.  But Miranda's family is a frying pan waiting for Eddie to leap into after the fire.  Miranda herself proves to be not too stable, and Eddie has enough character flaws to deserve both women and plenty more.While this movie was definitely funny, what I liked best was its unpredictable and open ending.  It was not the quick fix, or rescue scene, or typical ending I had in mind when I saw the previews.  For a few laughs, I would recommend this video - but put kids to bed first.",1285632000,"09 28, 2010"

Either that or the director and/or script was so lame that it made her look bad.4) I think what topped it for me was this attractive woman with her baseball hat on backwards (whats up with that?!) and makeup all done up and she is the comms specialist for some secret government agency (no dress code?). She just keeps looking pretty and trying to look tough while pushing buttons and giving updates to the Stephen Dorff when he can see for himself what is going on. Really Dumb!!5) The director cannot create a suspenseful scene for the life of him. They relied too heavily on special effects and less on finding a better director.Overall: Not worth even renting.

TOO MUCH PROFANITY - DISAPPOINTED IN ROBIIN WILLIAMS MOVIE,1425600000,"03 6, 2015"
"Karin is one of those unmistakably quirky but loveable Geneon properties that many anime fans (such as myself) feared would go down with the ship.  Fortunately, Funimation has been diligent in their efforts of tossing out the lifeboats for countless such titles by re-releasing them to the North American market in all their original glory.Released across 6 DVDs, the Funimation version of Karin consists of three thin packs (each containing two discs) within a tasteful cardboard slipcase.  The show comes in at a 580-minute runtime and wears a fairly conservative 13+ rating.  There is no real nudity to report (save for some covered-up body models in the opening) and the language is friendly to viewers of all ages.  Sure there are a few juvenilely creepy vampire moments, but in all, this is definitely a title that will charm members of all age demographics.The story goes something like this: Karin Maaka may seem like a perfectly normal teeny-bopper/ high school student with all of the usual dilemmas to keep her occupied: Dating, zits, anemia and the desire to bite into people's necks.Sure that last one isn't that uncommon among the teenage set, keep in mind that our title character is in fact the middle child in a family of futuristic vampires who've made Japan their home.As if being a vampire wasn't enough, Karin is a reverse vampire (or an ""un-vampire"" as the case may be).  This means that she doesn't rely upon sucking the blood of others to live but rather makes her own supply just like the rest of us.  Before you start to wonder if you are in fact a vampire as well, her condition is unique in that she makes too much of the red-stuff and has to bite others to get rid of some of her own.Here's the catch, Karin literally has to get rid of her excess corpuscles or risk volatile nose-bleeds as her body rids itself of the extra blood.  The good news is that her victims don't suffer from the bite/ injection but actually feel revitalized and refreshed (a trick that I'm forced to reply upon Red Bull to duplicate).Another interesting facet of her ""condition"" is that the mood of those surrounding her has a distinct effect on her body's blood affinity.  In other words, Karin's body starts working in overdrive in blood production when she's around miserable people (good thing she doesn't live around here).  As such, the poor girl is often found doing all she can to try to better the moods of those around her.Following in the footsteps of such classic shows as The Addam's Family or The Munsters, a lot of Karin's appeal comes from the fact that her family life is, for all facts and circumstances, surprisingly normal.  Karin shares room and board with a brother, Ren and sister Anju with some fairly stereotypical parents (think protective father and quick-to-butt-in mother).While her family may play the more traditional vampire role, Karin herself (don't forget she is an un-vampire) lacks some of the typical traits such as vulnerability to sunlight, night vision, and the ability to erase memories.  Yes she has the fangs but that only inhibits her on class-picture day.The show itself just plain works, partially because Karin is a lovable lead character and partially because the whole vampire angle adds a nice element of mystery to the typical high-school comedy genre.The show is as much High School Musical as it is Twilight and that's not a bad thing.  The heavy load of hiding the fact that she and hers are technically members of the ""living dead"", teen romance, high school shenanigans, and a whole lot of coming of age in the modern world spruces things up.Perhaps its greatest strength is how tastefully and humorously the context manages to parallel Karin's unique blood dilemma to the budding menstrual cycles of all girls of similar age.  As such many of the situations and tense moments have an inherent scale of relatability and realism.Karin's biggest weakness comes in the form of the art and animation, which isn't anything spectacular.  Not that either actually take away from a viewer's ability to enjoy the smooth pacing and just plain fun prose, the backgrounds and character models are nothing spectacular either.  The fan-service that managed to cause a bit of a reputation in the manga source-material has pretty much been eliminated entirely in the transition to anime (again except for the opening sequence, which hints toward much more risqu material than the show ever delivers).The sound track is a mixed bag as well with upbeat pop numbers and smooth instrumentals that perfectly accent the teeny-theme of the show but the English dub isn't one of the strongest out there.  Like the visuals, the dub work is passable but not quite the butter-smooth masterwork that is so common with Funimation properties.In all, this is a fun show that manages to capture the small moments of teenage life and blend them with a fictional backdrop nearly perfectly.  Because the writers initially decided to add a unique twist on the vampire theme, Karin ends up being one of those rare shows that will hold viewer interest regardless of their personal genre tastes.  The humor works and the drama never becomes so heavy that it drags the well-constructed prose down.",1243382400,"05 27, 2009"

"Walk the Line is a biographical musical drama that is based on the early life and career of country music artist Johnny Cash. The story focuses on his early life,his first family with Vivian Cash,his romance with June Carter and his rise to stardom as a country singer. It was based on numerous autobiographies. It features Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively. James Mangold co-wrote the screenplay and directed the film.The story includes Johnny Cash's childhood wherein he experienced his battering from his abusive father and tragedy after his brother's accidental death. Then we also witness his troubled first marriage with his first wife due to his financial and emotional instability. As a country singer,we get to see his ascent into stardom in the music scene. As his fame grew,he struggled with amphetamines,barbiturates and alcoholism. But upon meeting June Carter,it helped him overcome those struggles and her support provided him more success later in his career.This was definitely a great film due to the performances of both Phoenix and Witherspoon as they give us first rate work. Although the screenplay may be a boring and slow at times,we are definitely treated to an acting extravaganza. Both performers were able to capture what Johnny Cash and June Carter are all about and their devotion to each other definitely provided lots of intrigue to the movie in spite of their supposed personal weaknesses and life struggles. Also worth mentioning is the music played in the story as it allows us to hear the popular songs and remind us of the performances of both country music legends. These are two reasons why Walk The Line deserves the highest rating.",1428710400,"04 11, 2015"

"In deference to Never the Twain:  Very mild plot spoiler in this review-- definitely doesn't affect overall plot.I am always on the lookout for a new Sherlock Holmes movie.  I couldn't wait until this came out, because it looked good and it was produced by the BBC-- which also produced the wonderful and never-to-be-duplicated Jeremy Brett series.What a disappointment this was!First of all, the villain here is Irene Adler. Why on earth was Irene Adler made the villain?  Adler was the only woman Holmes ever really respected and thought he could care about. And, in the Scandal in Bohemia, she clearly isn't a villain. She wrote Holmes a wonderful and caring letter and both Holmes and Watson were left with deep reverence (or at least respect) for her.  She is ""The Woman"" in Sherlock Holmes' life and was never, ever villainous at all.So, why did the BBC or the scriptwriter or WHOMEVER make Irene Adler one of the most evil and diabolical villains to ever exist?  This really is an outrage, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan.  There is nothing in any past Holmes story to indicate that Irene Adler would ever turn into a murderous, conniving, vindictive evil villain.  At the end of ""Scandal in Bohemia"", we are all convinced she is a good, honest, savvy person who earned the respect of Holmes.  This was such a disappointment that, had the rest of the movie been actually good, it still would have ruined it for me.Why not make Moriarty the villain? It is clear from some comments Watson makes that Moriarty is still alive. There is no reason to impugn Irene Adler's legacy by making her this type of villain.Secondly, the casting was not very good. Jonathan Pryce is a good actor, but there was nothing about him that made him Sherlock Holmes. He definitely didn't 'own' the character.  Of course, once you are hooked on Jeremy Brett, nobody can ever really be good enough.  But, still, Pryce was 'just a detective'-- there was nothing about his acting that made you believe he was Sherlock.  He wasn't brilliant. He wasn't extraordinary. There was nothing at all about him that was special.  And, the character (as created in this film) made one or two comments about others' lack of intelligence.  Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes would never do this.The actor playing Watson, on the other hand, was fine.  A little bit jolly, but definitely not insultingly doltish as portrayed in other films. Mrs. Hudson was sadly missed here.Third, I think this is a television pilot.  I'm not sure, but it seemed so. This entire movie seemed to be a setup for a future family-friendly series about the Baker Street Irregulars.  Holmes talks to them about how they should be taking care of themselves for when he isn't around anymore and there are a couple of plot lines that are clearly left open for a future story.  If this is a planned television series, the casting department certainly needs to recast some of the Irregulars' parts.  Most were decent, but there was one shorter boy that wasn't very good and Sadie, the lead Irregular, was horrible. She was so horrible that it was hard to have any empathy at all for her character.All in all, I really wouldn't recommend this.  It's definitely not for the Holmes purist, and I doubt it's for too many others, either. Even with the pre-teen and teen protagonists, I can't imagine too many parents anxious to push this as the first Holmes introduction to their children.  The embalming might make some parents decide against this. Personally, I would let my preteen and teen watch this if it was good, but I don't think there would be any benefit to do so. It's just not worth recommending at all.Instead of buying this, get absolutely anything with Jeremy Brett. And, if you've watched all of those, try the Murder Rooms.  Those are excellent.Edited to add: One reviewer here, referring to my review, believed that my review was a spoiler because I mentioned Irene Adler.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Irene Adler is mentioned as the villain in other reviews elsewhere and we find that out early on (and expect it the second Watson lets us know that Irene Adler is filed under ""evil villains"" in their filing system). The mystery is actually catching Irene and trying to figure out how she's doing what she's doing-- and why.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007"

"The movie has an opening shot of Scarlett Johanssen's buttocks-which proves to be prophetic.With Bill Murray, I was expecting this to be a comedy. But it is not-unless you count the scenes of Japanese people acting like crude stereotypes.Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who goes to Japan to do a Japanese whiskey commercial, staying in an expensive hotel in the process. Scarlett plays the wife of a workaholic, also staying at the hotel while her husband is involved in his job, leaving her alone. Basically it's a pastiche of scenes of everyone talking, or lying around in their hotel rooms, or interacting with Japanese stereotypes, until the two meet in a bar. But then I stopped the movie-too many long,boring scenes of nothing happening. And from the negative comments here, I realized that there was no reward if I had watched to the end.My review title means, in Japanese, ""This movie is boring."" I wonder if any Japanese saw it, and if any of them liked it.",1472256000,"08 27, 2016"

"Yes, the male character (Boaz) is very handsome.  But he has no real definition, other than his body.  He never resolves his homosexual feelings in a responsible way for himself and his girlfriend.  He seethes with conflict throughout the film, and in the end winds up marrying his girlfriend and having two kids (maybe more ultimately).  That's NOT a resolution (except, of course, to Christian fundamentalists--but this is Israel, so no excuse).Boaz's girlfriend/wife is beyond belief.  After he suddenly grabs her and rapes her, doggy style, she's naturally traumatized.  But all she can say afterward is ""It hurt"" and ""Don't ever do it again.""  I'd have kicked him in the crotch and moved out, no matter how handsome he is.Later, when she figures out who the anonymous man who writes Boaz love letters is--yes, she reads all Boaz's private mail--and confronts the letter writer, she tells him, ""Leave Boaz alone.""  As though it was all one-sided, even though Boaz has saved every letter, has raped her doggy-style, and cries out that he's suffocating with her.  But at the end, they're married, one kid here, one on the way, and she smiles happily.  Does she honestly think that Boaz will never take up gay sex again?Finally, the depiction of gay life--the furtive sex with strangers in dark places, the endless cruising, the just caring about getting off--is reminiscent in its ugliness of the gay bar scene in that beyond-dreck Otto Preminger movie ""Advise and Consent.""  Unlike in that movie, though, no one commits suicide in this one.  Although the anonymous letter writer is probably on the verge of it.  But that's this movie's only saving grace.(In all fairness, this shows gay life in Israel in 1989, so it might have been much bleaker then than it is now.  Fast forward to 2017, and it's a pretty good guess that Boaz is in Tel Aviv's famed gay pride parade with his equally hunky lover--that is, if Boaz somewhat kept his looks--while his wife stews bitterly over the miserable life she's had.  She shouldn't have ignored all the red--make that crimson--flags back in 1989!)Highly recommended--by Christian fundamentalists and ultra-orthodox Jews everywhere.",1498176000,"06 23, 2017"

"I LOVED Leslie's Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan. Those 12 min miles can be killers! This one, not so much. It was 30 min before I started sweating, and I was using a 3 lb pair of walking weights! The Hiit training was ok. It was really just 30 seconds of jogging, then 2 min of bringing the heart rate down (maybe a little too much), then repeat that a few times. The 1 mile marker came in at 15 min, 2 miles at 29 min, and 3 miles came up after the stretch, which was a little weird to me. Leslie is her usual bubbly self. I love her. But this one just wasn't as good as the 5 Day Walk Plan. She even calls this an advanced walk at the end of the workout. There's lots of bouncy, high-impact moves, maybe that's why, but it was definitely not as hard as the other one. If you are just starting out, this would be a challenge, but if you're used to more intensity, this one might leave you a little disappointed.",1380672000,"10 2, 2013"

Defender showed again what and intense and nuanced actor Jet Li  is and can be.  He is the best martial artist as always. If you liked any  of these films you must see Romeo Must Die.  Jet Li never had such great  chemistry with his leading lady, as he had with Aaliyah. Jet Li is the best  and will always be a favorite of mine!",963532800,"07 14, 2000"
"Some movies from the era stand up.  Not this one - all-star cast notwithstanding. Couple of plot holes, and a few very non-Holmeslike leaps of faith that, in my view, broke faith in the underlying nature of the character.",1466035200,"06 16, 2016"
"Wish I had a dollar for every Henry VIII movie I've watched. This version of Philippa Gregory's best seller deviates from the book, so I'll review it on its own merits.What I liked:The costumes and scenery.The casting - it's refreshing to watch lesser known actors in such familiar roles.The portrayal of Henry as less megalomanic and somewhat more human in his relationships with men and women alike.The portrayal of Anne as every bit the match of any male courtier who schemed and plotted for advancement.The understated treatment of the execution of Anne Boleyn.What I did not like:The weasel-y characterization of George Boleyn and the absence of his wife in the plot.The omission of Cardinal Wolsey as a major player in Anne's drama.The depiction of the incest between Anne and George as a documented fact.The absence of others who undoubtedly masterminded Anne's downfall.The ""video-diary"" monologues, used as summary shortcuts.Like many made-for-TV movies, The Other Boleyn Girl could have been better, but it also could have been worse. (Like its 2008 big screen counterpart.) I'd watch this version again, even without the dollar.",1246579200,"07 3, 2009"
"Judi Dench does a fantastic job of headlining the BBC miniseries Cranford.  Cranford is a small, rural, English town, and the miniseries follows the lives and times of people who live there.  The main storyline centers on a group of elderly unmarried women, including Dench.  There is also the Lady who lives in the manor house and who is the local member of the house of Lords.Life in rural 1800s England is a happy and tragic thing.  Though the town has a doctor, there was little that doctors could do at the time to deal with disease or serious injury, and death was a common part of life.  At the same time, people found joy in each other's company and the small and simple things of life.This series has a sort of Dickinsonian/Austenesque quality to it.The sets are fantastic, the costuming is amazing, and the storylines and acting are top-notch.  I found myself gaining an increased understanding of and appreciation for England and the English experience through watching this miniseries.Of course, this series is not for everyone.  If you are guy looking for an action-adventure flick, keep on walking, you won't find what you are looking for here.  If, however, you are a viewer who enjoys history, period films, drama, and BBC-style work, then welcome home!5 stars all the way.P.S.

It was amazing how involved I got with the jealous brother--a sign of great acting and directing.This movie really is a must see.

This story has potential - and the scenery and the heroine were beautiful.  I'd say it was worth watching - even a second time.  I think it's also worth re-doing as a film . . .The only things I'd change are:  > The man she falls in love with is too hard towards her.  He may miss his previous wife but there is no reason to be as unkind as he is throughout the movie.  > His bringing the pony in at the end is a little lame.  Again - if he hadn't been such a jerk throughout the movie his offering at the end might have made more sense.  > The actor is fine . . . . I just think his character could have been softened up a little bit.The gal that plays in this movie is so worth watching that she almost pulls this movie off in the end by herself.,1251676800,"08 31, 2009"

"As the music swells we open on a close-up of a tear being birthed by an eye in which we see a reflection of missiles falling on Manhattan.  As the point of view shifts we see nuclear explosions erupting all over the city.  I love me a good end of the world movie and Xavier Gens had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene to the very end so I didn't wonder out loud why our heroine didn't go blind as she was looking directly at the blast.  This movie is a really fun ride in spite of its flaws.The action starts with the panicked residents fleeing their apartments and further explosions as they're trying to escape which sends 8 to the basement where the super, Mickey, lives and where the nightmare unfolds.  Luckily for everyone Mickey is a bit psycho and has been planning for such an event in the years since 9-11 so he just happens to have a lot of food and weapons stockpiled.  Smoke `em if you got `em because it's going to be a long few weeks.  A lot of smoking takes place.This could now go in a variety of directions.  ""The Road"" comes to mind; who will be the first to be dinner when the food ultimately does run out?  It's definitely not the special effects laden ""The Day After"" nor is it the solemn humanity and quiet death of ""On the Beach.""  Nope, it's a psycho-sexual horror movie as satisfying as any even if by the climatic end you realize you've been had.As tempers begin to fray they can hear the building collapse on top of them and after a brief silence and a knock on their door, followed by banging , we see a torch welder cutting  through the steel door.What comes through the door is a small group wearing hazmat suits.  A child is dragged from its mother's arms, something is squirted into her mouth and an injection with a hypodermic the size of a baseball bat goes into her neck.  She is loaded, screaming and crying into a body bag and removed.  Then the troopers go after the survivors who fight back.  Our survivors take out the two remaining storm troopers and tend to their wounded.Wearing one of the hazmat suits one of the survivors opens the door and goes into the unknown.  He walks out not onto streets of destruction but into a biohazard like tunnel system made of hazmat  plastic.  Our survivor continues until he finds a lab and sees the children, shaved heads and eyebrows, taped eyes and tubes in their mouths.  Each are in their own stasis module.  A fight ensues with some of the troopers who discover he's an imposter and he takes them out and retreats back to the basement shelter.  We see the arc welders again at the door and someone screams ""They're coming back!""  Mickey says , ""No.  They're welding us in.""  This is high concept apocalypse after all.Sharp, tight dialogue and a clever script keep us on edge as their options, patience, sanity and humanity run out faster than their food supplies as it is discovered Mickey has been keeping hidden his stash of food.  This plot point keeps them alive as they descend further into the depths of depravity.  After an hour and a half of madness our heroine is all that's left and she dons a hazmat suit, and descends into the septic tank where she finds another way out and climbs up covered in poo into a dead world.And that's the problem.  Where are the hazmat guys and where and why and what was all that about.  Apparently it was a story arc that went nowhere and was just a gimmick to get a hazmat suit in the shelter so she could escape without ruining her pumps in poo water.  But really?  Compared to the disappointment of not having that story arc resolved it would seem that a better script would have had her make her way through the waist deep poo water without protection.  Her climbing up into a dead city would have created a stronger scene, put a period on that sentence and would have not left those of us with enough brain cells working to figure out that the whole hazmat deal was a gimmick to get that hazmat suit down there for her to use.  Considering how psycho Mickey was it wouldn't have been surprising were he to have one stashed there as well so that whole story arc seemed unnecessary.None of this means the ride isn't a whole lot of fun and you can see the actors digging deep to perform their psychotic dance but you feel a little cheated because you really want to know who the hazmat guys were and what they were doing and that doesn't happen",1396656000,"04 5, 2014"

"This is a haunting film that has stuck with me for weeks since I first saw it; the kind of film that poses important questions without sacrificing the kind of narrative intensity the subject -- the murder of thousands of Polish officers held prisoner of war by the Soviet Union in the early years of World War II -- demands.From the opening shot, when a group of refugees fleeing the invading Germans encounters another group coming from the opposite direction and fleeing from the Soviet Union -- which has taken advantage of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviets to move in and occupy the eastern half of the country -- the stage has been set for the conflict. In the middle are the hapless Poles, with nowhere to turn; their only allies hundreds of miles away in France and England, showing no sign of running to help them. In Krakow, one character, a university professor, is deported to a concentration camp by the Germans; his son, an Army officer, is imprisoned by the Soviets. What is there to choose between them?The story revolves around the choices made by the characters -- to live or to die, to accept historical distortions in the name of surviving and moving forward with their lives or to deny those in the face of horrific consequences. The film deals with a number of characters -- the wife of a general, the wife of the major, their daughters, their extended family, the two sisters of an engineer turned aircraft designer -- and their lives before, during and after the war, as well as that of one who miraculously escaped the carnage of Katyn forest, but becomes a victim of a different kind.Initially, some aspects of the film struck me as slightly propagandistic, not so much in the sense of being anti-Soviet (although that is definitely a major theme) but in the sense of Polish nationalist. Still, I was quickly caught up in the story, thanks to the director's wisdom in noting that it is systems and people who adhere to those systems in a rigid way who are to blame, rather than individuals. While both the Soviets and the Nazis are displayed as despicable, it is a Soviet officer who performs a remarkable service for one of the army officer's wives early on in the story.What is truth, and to what extent will people insist on their right to the truth when the price to be paid is nearly total -- freedom, peace of mind, friendship, etc.? Do we owe a greater loyalty to those who are dead, or to ourselves when they are gone and we can no longer do anything for them? Few films have the guts to tackle such complex issues and to do so in an honest fashion. Some of the answers -- as portrayed in the film, at least -- may be idealistic and even a bit unlikely, but such is the grip of the film that this didn't even occur to me until days later, and even then didn't cause me to question my impression of the film.We know a lot about the Holocaust, thanks to films such as Schindler's List. This film may be the start of a wider-ranging debate about other kinds of war crimes, which, although they don't measure up to the horrors of the Nazi-designed genocide, should not be forgotten. This is definitely a polemical film, with a strong anti-Soviet/anti-Russian message, but it hews very close to what I know of the history of the period, and the wartime and postwar experience of Poland explains much about the current political state of Central Europe.This is a startling and remarkable film that I'd recommend strongly to anyone with an interest in the period or a taste for cinema (vs Hollywood blockbusters). This isn't a star vehicle; it's an ensemble cast of actors who will be unfamiliar to most in North America, and the story skips quickly from one narrative to the next. It repays the effort.

"So what do we have here in this women in prison flick, a ""true story that happened to real people""?  To start with, no decent entry scene for the pretty heroine, who is imprisoned unjustly or something, I didn't have the sound up.  But after too much plot, there is a very good wet towel whip scene to introduce her to the inmates, followed by some minimal afro lez.  A doctor's office scene is wasted, no exam, and he's male, so no doc lez.  Much more plot, and we finally get a hosing down scene with leering guards, but only topless.  More plot, and there's actually a hanging scene, somewhat rare in these things, but it's too short and fully dressed.  Finally after way too much plot get we some decent warden/guard lez, a refusal, and then some threatened baton abuse that gets warm but turns into a more extensive lez out, pretty decent, R rated but full frontal.  Then there's  partially nude catfighting and some prisoner lez that nevers gets started, and you can turn it off right there, the rest is plot.Well, what can you say about a WIP film that includes NO SHOWER SCENE??  Unforgivable.  Franco got away with that once, but then his WIP movie was almost totally topless, which made up for it. And no whipping either, aside from the towel.  I don't know, two sleaze scene stars I suppose, one for the towel scene (can you imagine why that didn't happen in the shower room?), 1/2 for the asphyx scene, maybe a 1/2 for the nudity, but the NTRL factor is pretty low.

"Although a bit schmaltzy and hammy in places, TBYoOL conveys deep feelings of Americans about the heroism and debt of gratitude owed to the men who defeated Nazi Germany and the Japanese.  Three perspectives are bundled together - the rich man who's come to know the working-class man as his brother in arms, the poor man whose army glory far outshines his pedestrian civilian life, and the disabled veteran who must come to grips with his limitations.  Each man is given greatest respect, presented to the audience as a noble warrior returned home with a new perspective on who they are and what they want from their lives.Idealistic, over-simplified?  Sure.  But what's being conveyed through the film isn't intended to be the harsh reality of soldiers and sailors adjusting to life after war.  The purpose of the movie is to embody the nation's love for their fighting men, to say that times may be tough as they adjust, but that the American people recognized the fighting men as heroes to a generation.",1155600000,"08 15, 2006"

"I just can't even begin to comprehend all of the stellar reviews for this absolute rubbish of cinema.  It has no redeeming qualities at all.  I can, on the other hand, understand the negative ones.  Unfortunately, those  people are smart and choose not to express this disbelief of this slop in  so many words.  I, on the other hand, was so riveted by how God-awful this  movie was, I must tell you all about it.The movie is about a fairly poor  off gentleman named Tom Ripley and his plight for something great in the  world.  Tom, played extremely dully by Matt Damon, seeks out fortune by  trying to convince a young spoiled brat (Jude Law) to obey his father's  wishes and come back home to America.  It helps that this request by the  father of the boy sends Tom to Italy and with his boss's money.  So Tom  gains the friendship of this wealthy boy and his beautiful young girlfriend  (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Let me try and express this so-called ""talent"" of Tom.  It is seducing rich people into giving them all their life.  Well, it works  and Tom ends up fooling people into  thinking that he is now Dickie.  This leads to a duller than dish water  game of bouncing around beautiful young millionariess (Cate Blanchett) and  Dickie's ex.I really don't have the time nor the inoculation to try  and express more of boring storyline, but would just like to rant on the  acting of these big names.  The performances are so lackluster that you  become shocked that many of these names are well known.  Even Cate, whom I  really like in many movies, can't carry off her performance as a pampered  American princess type.  I could hardly tell if Gwen is playing yet another  Brit or just a snobby ""colonist"".  The only thing even worthy of being  called acting is the somewhat threateningly cleaver character played by  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He might really be something big soon.  However,  one the reasons this film was so exclaimed was the big debut of Jude Law.  Personally, I don't get it.There are two big questions to ask after  reading my review.  Why did so many people enjoy this film?  I have no idea  but I think it could be just the scenery but with a story so inspiring and  just plain not entertaining, you can't even be thrilled with the tourist  attraction angles.  Take the trip to Rome if you have to because it will be  worth it.  After that, why was this movie so praised by critics.  Personally, I feel they got paid.  Just kidding, but seriously I think it  was some kind of love affair/admiration for Law whom gave this movie such  buzz.  His performance isn't the best, but perhaps a far 2nd to the sly  Hoffman.  The same kind that there was for Damon a few years ago.  Better  stop listening to those critics all the time.So I guess this ""next  biggest thing since Sliced Bread"" is very moldy and green.  I'm not  shocked.  Maybe there is hope.  Maybe I'm cynical and just didn't see the  magic.  Then again, I was watching with someone else and they agreed whole  heartdely.  Keep in mind this is the same man that brought us that little  cinematic gem ""The English Patient"" Almost an unfair comparison as to which  is worst, but this takes the cake.  At least there where a few good things  about that story.  So unless you like that kind of trite film making of  visual beauty over a good story and acting, this is one to get but I have a  fair idea that most people with any taste for a real chiller will be bored  to tears with this film.  I have seen B-movies that make this look very  bad.  At least there is a camp quality to those films while this one tries  to hard and just fails on all counts.  Where is Morgan Fairchild when you  need here?  I must recommed you avoid this and save yourself some pain.  There are two kinds of movies I remember.  Really great ones and awful  stinkers.  I hope this venting of my feelings on this one will help me get  over it.",967766400,"09 1, 2000"

"*** This review may contain spoilers ****Plot and ending analyzed*Camila (1984) is a pompous, excessively melodramatic story that rarely rises above the crass emotionalism of a cheap novela, or tele-novela (a soap opera in Latin-American countries). The film stock reduces it even further, since it seems to have been shot on some 'video' camera. The angles are so dull and boring, there's hardly any life in this film at all.In the 1840's of Buenos Aires, Argentina, an utterly lifeless respectable woman, who later falls into the category of ""demimonde"", lives her boring life with her tyrannical father, who is overbearing, imperious and autocratic. At an instant, there's not much for us to root for, since these wealthy people are so repulsive. Yet the director, Mara Luisa Bemberg, thinks we should side with Camila, because she reads a few ""banned"" books. The director throws everything at us from afar, from the drowning of some pet cats on the tyrannical father's order, to the beheading of the bookseller. Clearly, she's not one to engage the audience with slow-nuances, but merely histrionics.Enter some Jesuit priest, Ladislao Gutirrez, equally boring and without merit. Well, Camila takes to him right off. I can't see how she falls for him so quickly, he's about as empty as a bare bottle that's molded up in the cellar. The rest of the story has the authorities searching for them after they've consummated their ""love"". Everything is brought down by a priest appearing out of nowhere, who finds them in some local village and they are executed.The film is pathetic, emitting little sympathy from clear-headed viewers; it is gut-wrenching in the extreme. Instead, it seems to be more of a tome or dictum intending to show how the affairs of the heart override any social order.",1476316800,"10 13, 2016"

EEGAH! (1963) is frequently shown (Starring Arch Hall (Sr.), Arch Hall Jr, Carolyn Brandt and Richard Kiel).  Another film with Arch Hall Jr. is Deadwood '76 (1965).  Billy May (Arch Hall Jr.) is on his way to Deadwood.  He meets up with a man Tennessee (Jack Lester) who is taking the same journey.  Tennessee is in search for gold so he can start his own business, The Tennessee Mining Company.  In town, Billy is mistakenly called ""Billy the Kid"" by an impressionitive boy.  To make matters worse, he has got Wild Bill Hickok (Robert Dix) on his tail and some Indians to look out for.  Can he make it alive out of this town?  This film is low-budget, but a good western story easy to follow.  The print of film that Alpha Video offers is not the finest, originally made for widescreen, but this version is standard with the borders of the picture frame cropped.

"I loved the Lord of the Rings movies, but I really don't know what's happening with these Hobbit prequels. There's a lot of action for the teenage boys crowd, but the story is getting even more convoluted. Here are my initial thoughts:GOODSome of the action scenes are entertaining. They tend to go on too long, but there are some gems. I particularly liked the ending battle. Even though it wasn't based on the book, there was some interesting symbolism and plot points in that fight.The set designs, landscapes, etc. are all gorgeous, as expected with Weta. Oh, and Peter Jackson did right by Smaug. I never thought I'd see a dragon emote so effectively on screen.Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo. His ability to convey ambiguous emotions non-verbally, through a single look or subtle body language, is incredible. Despite my disappointment with the Hobbit films generally, Freeman's has really become favorite depiction of Bilbo.BADThe action scenes go on way too long, again repeating a problem from the first Hobbit movie. At the theater, people were just laughing at some of the ridiculousness of the scenes (sometimes there were genuinely funny moments, but too often people were ""laughing at"" the film).I thought the rest of the dwarves got lost in this movie. Bombur has a ridiculous action scene. Kili gets some moments that are, well, interesting. The rest of the dwarves, even Thorin and Bofur, fall to the background. Gandalf is in the movie, but most of his scenes are action scenes. We very rarely actually see him interact with other characters, which is really a shame because Ian McKellan is so good at setting emotional moods for scenes.Ironically, the material from the book is shortchanged in favor of more non-book material. Beorn's house is a short sequence and we only see Beorn briefly. The dwarves are imprisoned in Wood Elves' realm for about 5 minutes, and most of that time is spent with Tauriel. The dwarves wait outside the secret door on Erebor for about a minute before almost giving up. There's little sense of time actually passing.By contrast, we get lengthy action scenes with Legolas and Tauriel. I don't mind Tauriel as a character, but her scenes felt totally unnecessary and contrived. In fact, much of the additional material felt unnecessary to the central story and I kept wanting to return to the dwarves and their quest. Likewise, the Gandalf scenes in Dol Guldur seem like they contradict parts of the Lord of the Rings films.OVERALLOverall, this movie is worth seeing if only for the visual imagery. Peter Jackson actually does the scenes that have roots the book quite well, though the problem is that those scenes are a minority of this film. I could see this actually being a great film if only Jackson had edited it more rigorously and cut a lot of the extraneous material.",1387065600,"12 15, 2013"
"And so the Clone Wars end pretty unceremoniously, with a whimper not a bang.It always had a difficult mission in some ways.  Telling a story set between two films we already knew how it would end.  Worse the 'heroes' Anakin Skywalker and the clones, were destined to kill off the other heroes.  I always dreaded how the series would end, would it dare to step into that dark territory?  Well we'll never know since Star Wars' new owners killed the program halfway through this season.So we're left with a lot of loose threads that go nowhere.It's a shame since they were getting close to the end and clearly setting up things we'd see in Revenge of the Sith and the original series.  But the constraints were also showing.For example we have a great storyline where the Jedi (finally!) discover the dark secret behind the clone army and... do nothing.  They simply decide they have no choice but to continue to use the clones.  No further investigation, no effort to follow up an earlier story about the chips inside every clone... Nothing.  Because that would ruin the plot of Revenge of the Sith.  So why bring it up?  You see the problem.Another arc pairs the 'hilarious' Jar-Jar Binks with Mace WIndu.  And again you wonder who, exactly, thought at this late date we wanted to see more Jar-Jar.The final arc follows Yoda on his quest to learn how to become a Force Ghost.  It's the sort of question no one really asked (he's a Jedi Master, of course he can become a Force Ghost) and is just piles of metaphysical nonsense strung together.  Some things are best left unexplained.The animation overall is gorgeous.  And certainly makes me wish the series could have continued.  Imagine if they'd gone on, telling Revenge of the Sith from other perspectives, or even going on to the Dark Times afterwards.Oh well.I'm sad to see Clone Wars go but it does make me feel hopeful about Rebels though.",1420761600,"01 9, 2015"

"I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt in other movies (10 Things I Hate About You, etc.) so I was excited to see that he had written, directed, and starred in this movie.  Unfortunately, after buying and watching it, I think he should stick to acting out other people's stories.  I wonder what made him dream up this plot.  Did he have a girlfriend who forbid pornography?  What is his point in the end?  He seems lukewarm about the one relationship where he supposedly learns to connect with a real live woman.  Unfortunately, it was just a really bad movie.  And, Scarlett Johansson, with all her beauty and charisma (normally), is just appalling as a spoiled Jersey rich girl.  The Jersey accent is extremely unattractive on her.  UGH.  Rent this one, if you must see it.  I wish I had rented instead of buying.",1389916800,"01 17, 2014"

"Released on Good Times Home Video this DVD brand new and plays excellent! Very satisfied with the seller I got this from. Great job in packaging and delivery!To me this is the best movie in the Airport series. But I do have one caveat, lol. And that is that Karen Wallace played by actress Lee Grant treated her husband played by the great actor Christopher Lee like crap. Then when disaster strikes, "" oh Martin stay with me just for a minute, just don't leave me alone."" Yes I know all dialogue in this movie beginning to end lol. Now don't get me wrong, I love Lee Grant, great actress. This entire movie is great! I remember the ABC network television premier back in the day. Had two parts. With other scenes added in that had more of the complexities of the characters. Like for example on the TV version first it shows the highjackers driving a white van getting the gas that knocks the passengers out later in movie. The main title and list of names played over this scene. Then after they get the gas, the movie then shows James Stewart flying the plane to his estate, like in the theatrical release. So yes buyers there is more to the TV version when it played on TV. I know cause I watched it. I was like in my early twenties then. Time flys doesn't it. Lol",1498176000,"06 23, 2017"

"Here's the real deal:  this movie is gross, disgusting, perverted, base, and plays to the lowest common denominator. I loved every minute of it.  A mix of There's Something About Mary and Thelma & Louise, this is raucous fun at its best, and the fact that it's three women having all the fun is sure to arouse some people's ire.  Personally, I found it absolutely hysterical.  I laughed continually from start to finish, and really, isn't that what a good comedy is supposed to do?  It's not witty and it's not Sheakespeare, but it is clever and enjoyable.The real surprise here is Christina Applegate.  She completely stole the movie away from Diaz, no easy feat (as Diaz is one of the biggest hams to come down the pike since Lucille Ball).

"Realism is a tricky thing to pull off in cinema, and nothing is less realistic when it doesn't work, but 'Intimacy''s big claim is to Authenticity, particularly in the now notorious sex scene.  'Intimacy' - about a bar manager and an aspiring actress meeting once a week for anonymous sex - deliberately opposes the prevailing cinematic trend towards CGI effects devoid of human interaction by asserting the Real, the Raw.  this isn't play-acting, fake, something we can forget about and dismiss as just a film - The Actors Are Really Doing It.  The title doesn't refer to the characters, whose inability to achieve intimacy it snidely undercuts: it refers to the pact between the director, actors and the audience, the promise that we're going to achieve a new level of emotional intimacy never before revealed on film, one that breaks the cosy boundary between make-belief and real-life.Ironically, this intimacy (for which we must take the filmmakers' word, as the scenes seem as simulated as any other film, the one nuzzling... scene rather coy compared to 'In the Realm of the Senses' or 'Romance') undercuts any attempt at realism or film-viewer empathy.  It is quite clear that we're not watching two characters, but two actors - their movements and grappling are stiff, stilted and self-conscious, as if aware that what they are doing is taboo-busting and, in a sweetly English way, are embarrassed about it.This gaucheness can't be excused as the characters' - director Chereau gets all self-reflexive and has a scene where Claire, a drama teacher, criticises two actors who are trying out a love scene.  This intellectual bad faith reminds us that we are not watching an English film, but a French one - when we first meet Jay, he is listening to the Clash's 'London Calling'.  This may suggest how out of date or trapped in the past the character is, but imagine an English or American filmmaker showing a corresponding Frenchman listening to 'Je ne regrette rien'.Too often the modes of French art cinema meet the content of British social realism and fail to gel - the unconvincing dialogue; the phoney mannerisms and delivery; the bogus idea that men will bare their emotional souls in macho English pubs; the 'party' scene like so many orgies from 60s European films.  The style is refried Wong Kar-Wai, Carine Adler and Dogme, with the abrupt editing, restless camerawork and close-ups spliced with the odd freeze-frame at 'pregnant' moments.At one point Jay says he can never tell, when at the theatre, whether the acting is good or bad.  I had the same problem here.  Because I found the situations contrived and the dialogue untrue, I couldn't believe in the characters, I didn't recognise them, they didn't teach me anything new about myself or anyone else.  There was no joy in the body, or even exploration of the body: this was a typical French view of English 'love-making' - quick, grubby, brutal, joyless, tangles of wobbly, sickly-white flesh.  But they did it for Real, so it must be Great Acting.",1001030400,"09 21, 2001"

"No matter what you hear, this is one really fun movie.  From the start with the frustrations of relationships within a neighborhood rock and roll band, to the development into a number one hit, this movie takes you on the ride from small Erie, PA across the country to Hollywood.Hanks does a tremendous job bringing together some unknowns to develop a great idea.  This band, the Oneders - then the Wonders - goes through changes and the movie seems to be like the life of both the early Beatles and the Monkees combined.  There is a 60s quality to the movie that gives it a very pleasant charm.  Innocence is really shown in the movie, then characters develop and become a little more experienced in life.The life of the bands working on a cross country trip as part of a record label as they track their meteoric rise to the top is especially interesting.There is one scene in the movie that actually can give you the chills, you really get a kick out of the joy the band feels as Liv Tyler and friends run down a busy Erie street, probably State Street, screaming and yelling and jumping up and down when their new song has hit the airwaves for the first time.  If there was ever a scene showing immense joy, this is possibly it.Well casted, well produced, the movie is a fun romp through the development of a Wonder.  The extras in the DVD are fun as well.

I really think Amazon should give the nuclear option of giving 0 stars.  Sometimes it is SO necessary.  I watched till the novelty of awesome badness grew stale, then quit.  I have rarely seen a movie in which EVERY element is hideous: the acting, writing, editing, sound, cinematography (I even hate to give it such a professional-sounding name), directing, lighting, sets, etc., etc.--EVERYTHING!  Plus, I'm fully convinced they accidently left out an entire reel, as the continuity at one point is so inexplicable, there can be no other explanation.  The sordid, repellent storyline tops it off.

"Anyone who has ever seen a movie had to know going in, that this movie was about more than just a man on a ledge. Unfortunately, this film couldn't have been more ridiculous.

Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell. The cast was talented and the previews were good, but this movie is not.

We have to worry more about home grown terrorists such as those involved in the Boston marathon bombings than people sneaking in.

"Sadly, it appears that Disney has decided not to continue with the Disney Treasures DVD sets.  Over the years, these two disc collections have included some fun and rare stuff that Disnerds like me have lapped up.  (Okay, so I've probably only watched about half of what I have, but I still want more.)  Disneyland - Secrets, Stories & Magic was released a couple of years ago, and I just now got around to watching it.  I felt like it didn't quite live up to the Secrets part of the title, but there are Stories and Magic aplenty.The heart of the first disc is a new 80 minute long documentary about the creation of the park.  It starts with the idea Walt originally had and covers the construction and opening of the park.  Most of the time is spent on Walt's years, and the time after he died is covered only briefly.  Over the course of the documentary, you get vintage and new interviews from Walt Disney, George Lucas, and various people who were instrumental in the park over the years.  While I enjoyed it and lapped up all the information again, I didn't really feel like there was anything new here.  Disnerd that I am, I knew just about every story retold already.  Not that I don't enjoy hearing them again, but I wanted something new.And that's where the rest of the disc comes through in shining colors.  The first disc also includes ""People and Places: Disneyland USA.""  This 42 minute documentary filmed in the daring, new technology of cinemascope, was made in 1956 and takes us to all four of the lands of Disneyland.  It really is a time capsule, and I found looking at the park I know and love as it was when it first opened fascinating.  There's also an audio commentary on this special with Disney and film historian Leonard Maltin and Imagineer Tony Baxter.Before we leave disc one, I should mention the trivia challenge.  I picked hard figuring I knew it all.  This wasn't as easy as it looked.  When you finally answer enough questions, you get a video ride through of some of the popular rides in the park.The second disc in the set contains some truly fun gems.  Up first is a 14 minute presentation never meant to air outside of ABC stations.  ""Operation Disneyland"" was filled to show them the work that went on to bring the live opening day broadcast to the stations.  Live TV sure was complicated back then.  Okay, so it's not worth watching more than once, but I enjoyed seeing it.The heart of this disc are three episodes of The Wonderful World of Color TV show from the 1960's.  Up first is ""The Golden Horseshoe Revue,"" a celebration of the 10,000th performance in the theater in Frontierland.  In addition to the regular cast of Betty Taylor and Wally Boag, we get appearances by guest stars Ed Wynn and Mouseketeer Annette Funicello.  This show is funny.  If the Golden Horseshoe still had something of this caliber, I'd make a point of going when I visit the park.Next comes ""Disneyland Goes to the World's Fair.""  For the 1964-1965 World's Fair, Disney contributed several attractions, all of which moved to the park when the fair ended.  We get a behind the scenes look at the growing field of audio animatronics as we see how they created such classics as it's a small world, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, and The Carousel of Progress.  There's not much new here, but I had a blast watching it anyway, especially since the last 15 minutes is a video trip through it's a small world.  (Yes, I can hear you screaming from here.)Finally, we get ""Disneyland Around the Seasons,"" a celebration of the 11th year of the park.  And what a busy year it was as the previous mentioned attractions opened.  That means we get some of the same behinds the scenes info on them, and a similar tour of small world.  We also get to see Mr. Lincoln's speech, and it's just as moving on video and it is in person.  This was also the year that New Orleans Square opened.  Finally, the special concludes with the Christmas parade from 1966.  Sadly, the joy of this special is tainted just Disney died just three days before it originally aired.But we aren't quite done yet.  Somewhere in the archives, they discovered time lapse photography of the construction of the park, and they've included it here with commentary by Tony Baxter and two other Disney employees.  No, this isn't riveting TV, but it is fascination to watch the almost 40 minutes and hear their thoughts on how quickly the entire park came together.If this had managed to unearth some new, surprising stories, I would have given Disneyland - Secrets, Stories & Magic a full five stars.  As it is, you've probably heard most of this no matter how big a Disney fan you are.  But the productions from the 50's and 60's are loads of fun and worth tracking this set down.",1431561600,"05 14, 2015"

"Gannon's wife and baby are brutally murdered and eaten along a lonely stretch of highway, and the police are powerless to find out the truth or stop the killings.  It is only after he is approached by an eccentric ""hunter"", does he realize the awful truth and vows revenge...""Hyenas"" is one of those films that you see on the shelf or you see the trailer, and you immediately say to yourself  ""That's gonna suck"", but the creeping curiosity and novelty of it being a werehyena film keeps echoing in your mind until you actually do rent or buy it.  For me, I was very skeptical, but when I watched it, I didn't hate it, and I actually found some merit in what it was trying to present even though it was no doubt a substantially flawed film.First off, to a casual horror fan, odds are you won't like this film.  It just has too much working against it to even compare to other good Indie horror movies.  So unless you have a soft spot for B-movies in general, or a slight inclining towards ""were"" or shapeshifting films, you can stop reading now.  For you dedicated fans of werewolf films, fans of therianthropy, or other more accepting horror buffs, you may find some enjoyment if you check this film out.  Maybe.  No, don't expect it to blow your socks off, and don't expect it to be anything more than it is---a low budget horror flick.  Don't even expect it to be good, more-so than it is passable.  But what is unique about this film; and its primary saving grace, is, it's about werehyenas, not the overused and barely done right werewolves.  So that factor in-and-of-itself gives this film something new compared to the mainstream, and it was a refreshing leg up to see.Another thing I appreciated, was, the werehyenas were cryptid human/animals.  They were not magical or supernatural, but biological.  They could only make more of their kind through natural childbirth by at least one parent who passed down the recessive trait, but they could not turn normal people into werecreatures by biting or scratching a surviving victim.  They could also be killed in any normal manner just like anything else.And finally, the hyenas are capable of a bipedal human/animal hybrid form.  During most of the film when people transform, they do so into relatively ""normal"" looking quadruped hyenas.  But in the second half we do see a dedicated bipedal hybrid form.  (More on that in a second.)Most of the special effects are CGI, and it's frustrating because in some scenes (not including stock wildlife footage) it looks like the hyenas are absolutely real and they had trained animals on the set, but in other scenes, they look painfully fake.  It's like they ran out of money halfway through the post-filming visualization rendering.  All the transformation scenes are the typical morphing CGI, but thankfully we also get prosthetics and makeup---and most importantly, the hybrid human/animal version of the werehyena is all makeup and prosthetics, but done in a minimal way that works.  No baggy fur suit, no cheap mask.  It's mostly body paint, with prosthetics mostly glued on the face, head, and hands.  And like with the film ""War Wolves"", the hybrid form are more geared to be humanoid with animal characteristics, rather than animals with human characteristics.  These creatures are scavenger hunters, and they have to share a kill with a large pack (around 15 - 20 members), so they are skinny and lean, and probably underfed by having to share meals and not being able to kill humans as much as they would like.  The full-body painting accomplishes two goals: first, it give the illusion of a pelt on the humanoid body, but just with very short fur.  Second, it maintains the illusion that everyone is underfed and lanky.  I'm not sure if this was intended or not, but it works to maintain that conceit.  (And the females in the hybrid form actually look kind'a ""cute"" in a weird, feral way.)  Now, granted I'm a huge fan of werecreatures done in a non-CGI style.  I prefer highly detailed practical costumes styled like those in the original  ""Howling"" or ""Dog Soldiers"" because it looks more real, but if the producers didn't have the budget to do something that elaborate, then I'm glad they went with the bodypainting/prostheses  route, because it still conveyed the look or a transformed person, just without the hokieness of a bad fitting suit.Unfortunately there are plenty of negatives that offset the positives:My main gripe is about the about the plot.  Things were very predictable, so I won't even go there.  However, I will mention the plot is essentially composed of four sub-plots moving along at the same time: a grizzled hunter telling the tale to us by breaking the fourth wall,  a man seeking revenge on the pack for killing his family, the impending death of matriarchal Alpha of the pack (and the new potential Alphas' battle for succession), and a turf rivalry between Latino and White gangs---or better put, wannabe gangs.  All of these plots are linked together and are resolved in a somewhat haphazard but marginally satisfactory manner at the end, but too much time is spread between them, so we don't get anything really substantial.  Instead, it's frustrating glimpses or cut and pasted anecdotes in which we're supposed to fill in the gaps with our suspension of disbelief, because the film doesn't have time to do it.The subplot with the two gangs could have easily been removed.  And while certain members play a role at the end, the majority was mindless posturing and some of the film's weakest acting. This whole sub-plot did nothing to move the basic monster plot forward, and all the pivotal characters could have been used in a better way that didn't distract from the main goal of this being at heart, a ""creature feature"".I also thought all the scenes in which Crazy Briggs (the hunter) is sitting around a campfire talking to us and breaking the fourth wall could have been cut.  He's okay as a hunter inside the fiction, but not when he looks us in the eyes and addressees the audience.  That's when he becomes cheesy and almost a joke.  There weren't that many scenes, but still, it was wholly unacceptable.  There were a few instances in which it looked like it was just a fake-out trick leading us to believe he was being cheesy and breaking the fourth wall, but in reality there were actually people off camera that he was talking to that we'd eventually see.  But nope, when the camera pans, it's just Crazy Briggs indeed talking to us as if we were there.There was even an absolutely terrible, TERRIBLE scene in which a redneck hick who makes Cooter from ""The Dukes of Hazard"" look like a Rhodes Scholar, is driving down the road and comes across one of the primary female hyenas pretending her car broke down to she can kill him.  His acting is atrocious, and his dialogue is even worse.  Any competent actor would be able to play the role---and through body movement or non-verbal acting, show the audience what is going on, but he actually advertises vocally everything he wants to do.  ""I gotta open the door to get out of my pickup.""  ""Boy, that strange woman with the tattoos standing seductively all alone on a desert highway at night is a hottie.""  ""Boy, I'd like to get into her pants became she's sexy and I now have a boner."" Not quite as shamefully blatant as that, but damn close.  It was just an awful, awful scene.  Why that was kept, or why anyone thought it was cool or funny, is beyond me.To sum up the plot arcs: too much wasted time.  All this filler junk should have been cut out, and instead, the film's focus should have been divided between Gannon's and Crazy Briggs's hunt for revenge, and the more intimate details of the pack and their dynamics.  After all, why craft a new world with werehyenas, when you don't even explore it past the sensationalism?  (Though to be fair, we do at least get an explanation of why African spotted werehyenas are running around in the U.S..  That's probably more than many other werewolf films would give.)My second big gripe, is, some of the characters were far too over the top, or just plain bad.  To maintain impartiality, most of the general acting was typical B-movie---not good enough for TV or real features, but better than a high school play and okay enough for the character being played to progress the plot.  Obviously some cast members were better than others, but those who were bad, were bad.  One example was already cited, but another example was some of the White gangbangers.  Nothing says poser like a tall and scrawny White guy wearing a stocking cap talking trash and acting tough, when he looks like he weighs less than a wet kitten and has skinnier arms than my sister.  Or even the leader of the White gang who's endless (ad-libbed?) pontificating is so poorly written; so badly delivered; and so unrealistic, that you can only sadly laugh because it not only embarrasses the actor, but it also embarrasses you, the viewer.  And there are a few other examples, but you get the gist of it.It never ceases to amaze me that directors, producers, Quality Assurance people, continuity checkers, or other crew members can't see these issues as glaring problems or bad performances on the dailies, or even on the post-production videos before the CGI is added.  This movie wouldn't be half bad if the fat and tripe were cut out, but I supposed if a writer is also the director (as it is in this case with Eric Weston), they want to keep everything because it has already passed their own personal biased acceptability filter.  That, or maybe there were too many producers with their own ideas they wanted put in..?The acting and plot constitute almost all of my gripes rolled up into one big ball.  However, the only other smaller issues I had, was, I felt the pack's composition seemed like it was based too much on the group of vampires from ""The Lost Boys"", and there was a scene at the very end that took place in an urban setting that did not need to be there.As for recommending this, that's a pretty tough call.  Normally I'd say no.  And for me, if it was anything BUT werehyenas, I'd say no.  But it really depends on your tolerance, not mine.  The bottom line is: this film had a good idea, and it had a lot of potential.  It took things into unexplored territory in concept, but it got lost in it and had to fall back on maps others wrote for directions.  And despite its efforts, ultimately it didn't do enough to break the mold of a bad B-movie, and not enough was realized.  As a huge fan of werecreature films, I was able to suspend my disbelief just enough to watch it, and I didn't think it was as bad as it could have been---probably because I've already seen the absolute worst werewolf films ever made: ""Werewolf: The Devil's Hound"" and ""Howling: New Moon Rising"", and it's unlikely any future lycanthropy or therianthropy films can be worse than those two piles of maggot ridden feces.  So compared to those turds, anything is better.  I'm also more forgiving because I'm taking this through a therianthropy filter by appreciating the hyena angle.  So if you're like me and have a Therian side that grants allowances of tolerance, or if you look for new types of werecreatures on the screen---and you know what you're getting ahead of time (via this review), give it a shot.  Odds are, you've probably seen worse, and this is at least a film you can laugh at.  But if you aren't predisposed as a ""were"" fan, or you have higher expectations that a singular aspect such as a new werecreature type can't justify, stay clear, because you'll find no redeeming value.(I would actually rate this 2.5 stars because to me, it fell between ""Dislike"" and ""Okay"", but since we can't do halves, I'm rounding down because there is more bad than good.)",1311033600,"07 19, 2011"

"When I first saw this film several years ago, I thought ""Wow, what a great film!  Very Hitchcock-like, and well paced....""I just saw it again last week and thought, ""What was I thinking?""  The pacing is slow and dreary, and the acting isn't even all that great.  The plot, while interesting, is not well executed and dragged like crazy.We're asked to suspend WAY too much reality in order to buy the multiple twists at the end.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  First of all, how in the world did that dead man manage to stay under water for that long without gasping for air?  It's never explained to us.  After that, was his body somehow replaced before being shoved into the crate and driven back to the estate, or did the (live) man actually live and breathe in that box, wrapped in plastic, for the entire drive back?And the biggest incredible suspension of belief factor in this movie:  If the cops were on to the bad guys for so long, WHY, OH WHY, would they sit back and WAIT until they've killed the headmistress of shock before they emerge from the shadows to arrest them?  I mean, an integral part of the conniving scheme was thinking that this woman was too weak of heart to do much on her own; surely if the cops had figured out the scheme they would have interceded BEFORE someone else had to die, right?  Even worse is that it all happens within the space of minutes:  Headmistress sees husband (whom she thought was dead), headmistress keels over and dies, and cop emerges from the shadows.  Hey, copper, could you not have stepped forward just a few seconds earlier, when you might have been able to save her life?A decent movie, but nothing terribly special.",1054339200,"05 31, 2003"

"There was A LOT of drama in the unaccounted for and unpunished creation and the punishing (to everyone except the at-fault profiteers) aftermath of the Great Recession, which in this work was only scratched at the surface and viewed from too limited a perspective in the telling of it.There was also, in the unavoidable, tactile plunder of the real event, a great deal of ugliness: the unbounded greed of the perpetrators, their arrogant, selfish ignorance and that of their aligned legislators, the latter not touched, the former rendered (mostly through the doubtful guilt written into Spacey's character) far too kindly.The Great Recession is the story of a tilted system that went criminal and should have killed itself, but instead was left standing tall amidst the rubble of broken and uncertain futures for all of its blood-drawn, dream-torn victims, spilling out obscene profits to its gear turners, Italian and London tailored in Teflon-smug at the kangaroo appearances before culpable committees in Congress, laughing all the way to their banks, yachts, and multi-million-dollar homes.All of this should have been, but wasn't, told.",1409788800,"09 4, 2014"

"I am a HUGE Batman fan and had nothing but excitement in mind when I saw the previews for this. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan decided that the worst movie he ever made would be his third Batman film. What went wrong? (No major spoilers here...if you've seen the ""I'm Gotham's reckoning"" previews for the film you know as much as I'm going to share)1. No Batman. You are 45 minutes into the film before you see Batman for the first time. After that, he's in and out for a grand total of about 25 minutes of screen time in costume. In the third film of a trilogy about Batman, this is pathetic.2. A boring villain. Yes, Heath Ledger is dead and it would have been a mistake to try and replace him, but to decide you've had a charismatic villain in the previous film so it's time to go with a plodding boring one in Bane for the second is stupid. Everything that made ""The Dark Knight"" interesting is lacking here. And thanks for deciding to make Bane's voice so hard to understand. It's just like in the comics...no, wait, it's not anything like the comics. It's just a stupid plot contrivance to be artsy. Oh, and the whole ""rich people are evil"" plot point was unnecessary.3. The sudden introduction of a major character for convenience's sake. Remember in the third Lord of the Rings movie where Sam picks up Frodo and carries him the final steps to Mordor? Now imagine if we'd never heard of Sam before the third film, and suddenly he has more screen time than Frodo. Nolan decides to conveniently take Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, and even Batman out of the film through one circumstance or another and put all the focus on a brand new set of characters we don't know or care about. Yes, Blake was an interesting character...but he should have been in all three films if he was going to be that important. And if you haven't figured out who he really is within the first 15 minutes of the movie you aren't trying.4. The plot. Trying to combine ""The Dark Knight Returns"", ""Knightfall"", and ""No Man's Land"" into one film seemed too grand...and it was. He should have taken something like ""The Long Halloween"" or even just ONE of his three choices and made it a movie.The only plus in this is Catwoman. Anne lights up the screen when she's there with the missing action and charisma we get from absolutely no one else. She needed Blake's screen time though.All in all, I was incredibly disappointed. Yes, I understand the whole thing was ""Batman is human""...but why in the world did Nolan decide the way to end his trilogy was to make it this horribly plodding film that should have had at least 30 minutes cut out of it. I'm sorry to see DC's movie franchise falter like this after Green Lantern. They just can't catch a break.If Nolan comes back for another Batman film, I'll give him another chance and definitely watch it. I mean, seriously, it couldn't get much worse than this.",1342742400,"07 20, 2012"

"Ridley Scott's sequel to the classic film Silence of the Lambs is a visually impressive but hollow follow up to Silence.Anthony Hopkins (who won an Academy award for his role as Hannibal Lecter in the original) displays little of his presence that was so Oscar-worthy first time round, and Julianne Moore is no Clarice Starling. But Scott's visual style, which is what makes all his films so eminently watchable (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator), and some expertly done sequences make up for its flaws.Gary Oldman is great as the cop who's chasing the elusive cannibal and Ray Liotta has some nice scenes throughout the film.But Hopkins has little to get his teeth into, and comes off as somewhat gauche. Impressive gun fights and some creepy moments with Oldman and Hopkins don't make up for the lack of suspense. A worthy, if sometimes unexciting entry into the franchise. The upcoming remake of RED DRAGON looks impressive, with Anthony Hopkins returning to the role for thr third time. Hopefully the next outing for one of cinema's greatest villian will better-written and more involving than Ridley's sequel.",1031788800,"09 12, 2002"

"Shock (Mario Bava, 1977)While Mario Bava put his name to Shock (known to American audiences as behind the Door II)-- the last film Bava was involved with before his death in 1980-- that probably wasn't a good move. Bava, whose career reached such heights as I, Vampiri (1956) and Bay of Blood (1971), never sank so low as this. Not even Danger: Diabolik! (1968) is this bad.Much of the blame rests on Mario Bava's son Lamberto, who in an interview included with the DVD says (admits to?) having directed over half the film himself. Anyone who's seen any of Lamberto's solo outings (Demons 2, Demons 3, Black Sabbath,Midnight Killer, etc. ad nauseam*) already knew that about five minutes into this dog. It's all the more disturbing given a high-powered, albeit small, cast and a script that might have actually worked in the hands of a director who understands how to build suspense. Mario, for example.The story (which isn't a sequel to the original Beyond the Door, incidentally; the only thing the two have in common is David Colin, who plays a different role in each movie) centers around a family who move into a new house. Well, not really a new house. The mother, Dora (Daria Nicolodi, a Dario Argento staple), lived here before with her first husband, who committed suicide years before. Her new husband (John Steiner, who also worked with Argento in the 1982 film Tenebre)is an angel compared to the first guy, or so everyone seems to think. Dora's child from marriage #1, Marco (David Colin, who never acted in another film after this), is also along for the ride. By the family's first night in the house, Marco is starting to fall under the influence of something rather nasty.Yes, you've seen a bunch of possessed-kid flicks before, but there's enough here to have made this one compelling (Bava has a take on the Oedipus complex that's just plain nasty-- some of the few scenes that actually make this worth watching) had it been done correctly. However, any subtlety reflected in the original script is woefully absent here; foreshadowing is writ large enough for even the densest viewer to be able to spot any good jumps from a mile off, and the ending can be seen coming long before you actually get there. Not a good thing in a supposed mystery.Painfully, both Steiner and Nicolodi turn in good performances, and the soundtrack, originally credited to Libra (who have since been unmasked as Italian pop stalwarts Goblin), is as much a joy as is all of Goblin's other early work. However, Shock provides hard and painful evidence at how much less than the sum of its parts a whole can be. * 1/2(* Yes, Lamberto is credited with the original Demons. One wonders whether Dario Argento was just the writer on that one.)",1010966400,"01 14, 2002"

"SPOILER ALERT (Episode 1)With the realization that network television has to appeal to the common denominator, I still had a small hope that the writers would ""borrow"" from the works of say William R. Forstchen (One Second After), David Crawford (Lights Out) or even S. M. Stirling (Novel of Change Series). Unfortunately, what was actually produced was the aforementioned ""Hot Mess!""1.) While we don't know the cause, I can't imagine that an event strong enough to take down everything electric and combustion engines and solar powered devices and batteries and make modern firearms useless, would not cause the lights to go out in a synchronized format? For example, how was it that when the Matheson household went dark, the power across the street didn't go till they walked out on their balcony? Same thing with the car lights going off when Miles broke down2.) In that apparently the ""event"" also caused modern firearms to become ineffective (by virtue of the fact that most of the militia are either carrying muskets or cross bows and there is no conceivable way to claim scarcity after only 15-years), yet somehow the Captain of the militia has a functioning ""45?"" Perhaps this will be explained at some point in future episodes, though it is a glaring inconsistency3.) Nice orderly crops growing, everyone appearing to be well fed with a brief moderators comment that ""millions had died!""4.) Security. While there was evidence of a feeble looking wooden fence/gate surrounding the living area, it didn't appear that the crops were protected (no evidence of patrols) and there didn't seem too much thought given to creating a defensible perimeter. It was alluded to that they were ""under the protection"" of the Monroe Militia, though that didn't seem to include armed guards5.) On the 2nd night out on their trip to Chicago, they make camp inside a plane, which is both highly visible and has a fair amount of open area surrounding it, yet they don't feel that it is necessary to post a watch? This is despite the constant warnings re: thieves, bandits et al6.) We are supposed to believe that an attractive woman living by herself in a structure with no security features and with only a double barreled shot gun (another inconsistency) to protect herself, had not fallen victim to a predator?I do understand that a TV serialized version of the road would likely be too morose for the mainstream, however, choosing to go with a combined concept of SyFy (a la Stirling) and an TEOTWAWKI scenario (a la Forstchen et al) is ambitious enough. Unfortunately, Revolution is rife with glaring omissions on both sides of the equations' for reason that I can only guess are either a sacrifice for production or poor research.I like the heavy set former Google millionaire that had ""$80-million in the bank"" when the lights went out and Charlie with her barely covering midriff shirts and nice ""bounce"" when she walks is attractive enough. Also, there was one pretty good (if not realistic) action sequence.

"Ok, so lets take this into account before I evaluate the value of ""Davie & Golimyr"": I am a twenty-two year old male, and this movie was not made with me in mind.  For goodness sakes, this is a stop-motion retelling of the Biblical tale of David and Goliath that has gone straight to video.  The biggest star in it is John Schneider of ""Dukes of Hazard"" fame (and for younger fans, of ""Smallville"" fame).  The movie comes in a single disk, cardboard sleeved DVD that includes a set of free stickers from a Nick Jr. show called ""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!""  I am not the person who is meant to watch this movie.  Chances are if can read this, then you are not the target audience either.  No, this movie is squarely aimed at the toddler crowd.The little tots are not going to make note of many of the things I did.  They are not going to muse over the fact that this re-telling of the famous Bible story is so close to the original, that the makers might as well have just made another David and Goliath.  They aren't going to note that this kind of stop-motion comes off as fairly unsophisticated compared to recent releases of ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Wallice and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit.""  Chances are, they won't even pay attention to any of that.  Trying to bring my own childhood back into play, I believe that kids will enjoy this because the colors are bright, the characters cute, and the story still speaks to the underestimated personality in most young tots.Young ones who are already familiar with the story may get excited that, unlike Goliath, it takes two stones before the mighty Golimyr is taken down.  Otherwise though, they won't care about the production values at all.  This is not the best adaption of the story I've seen.  For me, the ""Superbook"" episode did the story more justice...ah, but I'm nitpicking now.  The movie is clean, colorful, and it will keep your kids busy for forty-five minutes.  So really, what's not to recommend?",1207180800,"04 3, 2008"
"This is a 4-DVD set, which takes some of the performances from most of the Live 8 venues.  Performances by a number of the ""big names"" who performed at the nine Live 8 venues appear here (there's about 10 hours of material).  This is a good set for a starter, to get a good cross-section of the artists and venues.  However, DVDs have been issued for at least some of the individual venues; so if you're more interested in getting a whole DVD of one of the venues, it's worth checking to see if the venue you want has been issued individually.",1195603200,"11 21, 2007"

"Bob Hope is a father trying to keep his daughter from growing up too fast, in I'll Take Sweden (1965) a romantic comedy that explores both the sexual morality of different generations, as well as different cultures.Single parent, and oil company exec Bob Holcomb (Hope), returns home from a business trip and discovers that his daughter JoJo (Tuesday Weld) intends to marry Kenny Klinger (Frankie Avalon), a guy who lives in a trailer, and who's primary talents appear to be singing, and riding a motorcycle.  Looking to put an end to the romance, Holcomb takes an assignment in Sweden, and brings his daughter along.JoJo's depressed spirits are lifted when she meets Erik Stenson (Jeremy Slate), a handsome playboy type who works at her father's firm.  While Holcomb was looking to cool things in the romance department, the liberal atmosphere in Sweden seems to have the opposite effect on both daughter and father, as Bob finds himself smitten with Karin Grandstedt (Dina Merrill), an interior designer who is redecorating Holcomb's residence.Morality has a double standard, in this sex comedy directed by Fred DeCordova (The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson).  We observe that love is not very predictable, no matter how much a father meddles.  Upset that Erik plans to take JoJo away on a tryst, Bob has Kenny hop on a Lufthansa Air flight to Sweden, so he can try to win JoJo back.  But this does not go as planned either.  After forbidding his daughter from running off, Bob and Karin slip away to a resort, the same place that Erik and JoJo have also sneaked off to, setting the stage for the film's comedic conclusion.I'll Take Sweden is mostly a light fun romp that has an agitated Holcomb trying hard, but not succeeding in managing the situation.  Tuesday Weld (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looking-for-Mr-Goodbar-VHS/dp/6300216853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looking for Mr. Goodbar [VHS</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Poison/dp/B000G6BLY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Poison</a>) is very solid, as is Jeremy Slate as the amorous Swede.  Dina Merrill is a good match with Hope, though her Swedish accent isn't always convincing.

It's good variety if you want a break from Leslie. I bought a digital copy and it's a bit annoying to use. I can't select which segment I want to watch.

"The movie is unsatisfying on almost every level.  You might begin to relate to the sheriff, who doesn't understand the thugs and gangsters overrunning his beloved land, the initial protagonist, who doesn't understand the lengths to which people will go to retrieve large sums of money, the assassins, who understand nothing, not even the depth of their own insanity, and the throw-away females, who aren't given enough time to be understood in any meaningful way.  The Cohen brothers apparently  failed to understand viewers' attachment to the characters they presented, so the off-screen, off-handed resolution of certain story arcs constitutes a presumably intentional failure to bring resolution, denoument, or any other conventional resolution to the viewer.  This near-total lack of comprehension and overwhelming series of failures on everyone's part was apparently considered brilliant by the Oscar panels, and I definitely do not understand that.  This may be a movie about failures, confusion and change, but if the ultimate test of a work is entertainment, satisfaction, lessons, or other message, then this movie is a failure.  Deliberate failure, in my book, is no different than the garden-variety version.",1205280000,"03 12, 2008"

For the type of movie it is (B movie) it was okay and it kept me interested even if the plot was formulaic. Some of the dialogue and actor delivery was a bit cornball overall it wasn't such a bad flick. I liked the ending because of the implications. This was certainly better than some other flicks of the same genre that rely on jump scares or ridiculous stunts to capture the interest of the audience. I guess I am old fashioned because I prefer a story that allows for the audiences' imagination to fill in the blanks (Lady in Black 1). The digital generation doesn't always have the patience for good yarn.Granted the acting was mediocre even by the one recognizably named actor but you can hang that at the director's feet. Even good actors can falter with poor direction and limited directing imagination.,1421884800,"01 22, 2015"

"Wes Craven stuck his name on this film even though he didn't direct it. Sometimes I like Wes Craven films, sometimes I don't. This time I really didn't. I liked the opening scene when the boy is hiding under the covers from the monster coming out of the closet. It led me to believe I was going to watch a truly scary film. But once into the film, it was predictable, badly acted, and just plain typical. I have seen all of this before. Childhood friends reuniting in their adulthood and having one thing in common, being traumatized as a child by a spook. Don't go in the dark because there are monsters there, and the monsters can't come into the light. This idea was just used in DARKNESS FALLS. I even got up to get something to eat without pausing the DVD, I just let it play on. I did enjoy the alternate ending much better than the one that was used. I won't spoil what the alternate ending is, but it would have made this movie much more original had it been the real ending.My opinion: Not memorable at all, not a film I will go back and watch again.",1067904000,"11 4, 2003"

"The positive reviews are fake. This movie is so boring and crappy that I can't think of anyone who could like this. This is NOT a horror movie. This would be accurately described as a ""dramatic thriller"". There isn't any gore. Nor is there suspense because the protagonists are never in any danger til the last 10-15 mins. But even then I couldn't feel suspense because the acting and characterizations are so awful that I couldn't feel scared for the characters. I bought this in an 8-horror movie pack so that makes it around 65 cents a movie. But I still think I could have used that 65 cents for something better.

She is a teacher who wants to sleep with a student, but does not seem to sleep with anyone until Ruffalo's Detective Malloy asks her questions about a gruesome murder.Frannie suspects Malloy, but Kevin Bacon's John Graham is a weird freak who she should also suspect.I am not sure what Jane Campion was trying to accomplish here, but it quite a tangled, sexual web that she weaves.

While she isn't my favorite character, I felt she helps make this season more enjoyable. Definitely worth your money and certainly a must for any collecter.

"I know, I know.These disks haven't been released yet - but I've heard Shout Factory has beautifully restored them - and I own the unrated (and rated cuts) of these classics on DVD and VHS. I've also taken a look at the special features - which are plentiful.I rate them (in order):Slumber Party MassacreSlumber Party Massacre 3Slumber Party Massacre 2I'm sure some will disagree with that assessment; but this review is to entice some folks who aren't familiar with this series to GET THEMSELVES ACQUAINTED - and the price is so great - why NOT order this collection???? These are CLASSIC cheesy flicks that inspired TONS of knock-offs and spin-offs.And for those who are interested; here's my rankings of the ""Slumber Party""/""Sorority House"" Massacre series - best to worst with star rankings out of five (knock-off's and spin-offs included):""Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982) - ***** The Original and Best - Brinke is HOT here in her cameo. A classic 80's slasher to go down in history.""Sorority House Massacre"" (1986) - ****1/2 Starts off slow - and then has an amazing finale. A great spin-off.""Spring Break Massacre"" (2008) - ****1/2 - Cheap for sure. But a welcome movie that was a BIG step-up from ""Cheerleader Massacre"". Linnea Quigley and Reggie Bannister are WELCOME anytime.""Hard to Die"" (1990) - **** - The unofficial ""Sorority House Massacre 3"" - but it contains stock footage from ""Slumber Party Massacre""? This one is so-bad-it's-good - and knew it. I LOVE this lousy clone of ""Die Hard"". Great fun. Forrest J. Ackerman has an amazing cameo.""Slumber Party Massacre 3"" (1990) - **** - Great fun. LOVED the next-door-neighbor with the telescope. Hope the re-release DVD is Unrated - because the New Concorde DVD I own is EDITED!!!! Still holding on to my VHS.""Sorority House Massacre 2"" (1990) - ***1/2 - CHEAP - but great fun. So-Bad-It's-Good in many ways. Boom mics and blood bottles throughout. Worth a purchase at a reasonable price for sure.""Slumber Party Massacre 2"" (1987) - *** - Kinda a rip off of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that doesn't make sense. Though Points for the killer with the drill in his guitar.""The Last Slumber Party"" (1988) - A knock-off that's so-bad-it's-good. Terrible film stock. Atrocious gore effects - but laugh out loud funny :-)""Cheerleader Massacre"" (2003) - **1/2 - LAME movie. Bad Video. Worth a rent or purchase (if cheap).

"I will always love ""Dallas"" and own the entire series, plus the first season of the new series.  I bought this season nine knowing it was ""all a dream"" which I did not enjoy for that reason.  But even more disappointing that the ""dream"" thing, I have to say this:  WHAT DOES EVERYONE LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT BARBARA BEL GEDDES????  Last season with Donna Reed was, to me and others I know, what the real Miss Ellie should be.  She was an attractive older woman who can act, dressed attractively but appropriately, and was just so real.  Barbara Bel Geddes has spent all these prior seasons lumbering about in ugly, colorless sack dresses not worthy of Jock Ewing's wife, staring off into space and seldom looking anyone in the eye as she drones her lines, and every once in a while she drawls ""Jayyyyy  Ahhhhhh,"" to J.R. or referring to him. To see her return in this season nine was the biggest let down for me.  Of course I knew she would be back, I'm old enough to remember watching the entire series on television. But the let down was no less because of that. I recommend buying this season for any true Dallas fans who want to own the whole series and make it complete, but to sit and watch it all as a dream -- I didn't do it.  I watched the first episode to refresh my memory, then put it on the shelf and went to Season 10.",1351900800,"11 3, 2012"

"This show is for the most part absolutely fantastic. The band is tight. Playing very good. Song selection great. They are happy and enjoying themselves. Video quality is excellent. My only nitpick is with the sound. The 5.1 HD has the opportunity to absolutely shine here. And for the most part it is really good. But all too often Lukather and Phillips are way too low in the mix. Had they engineered this with just a bit less audience noise and turned them up just a few db's each this would be a top 5 reference blu-ray concert. IMO opinion Falling In Between Live was not as good a show as this but the audio was slightly...only slightly better. But don't let that keep you from this. It's real good. Some of the older songs here have completely new life. If you have a good system buy it and crank it up. If for no other reason than ""White Sister"" This version absolutely kicks ass! 35 years old and rocks harder and better than 99% of the mass market crap out there today.",1399593600,"05 9, 2014"

I liked all of the funny, fancy gun play throughout.The special effects and the makeup are also part of the movie's overall charm.  You could tell that the movie was produced on a limited budget, but it all seems to fit to make it entertaining.It kind of reminded me of the first time that I saw ""The Evil Dead"" in a theater in the 80s.  It's funny, has some memorable characters and a fair share of gross (but comical) moments.

"I don't mind suspending my disbelief in the supernatural for a good scary movie. But this wasn't much in the way of scary. It was at least creepy, though. And in good ways- despite the ridiculous script.We know how the whole ""based on a true story"" drill goes, right? We all know that they change things in movies, yes? And that changes are even expected today and allowed and all that?So if you have the opportunity to change stuff- why not drop in a line somewhere that talks about how crappy it was that people murdered women as witches. And maybe we could do that instead of pretending that it is acceptable for someone living in this day and age to perpetuate the notion that victims of the Salem trials can still be regarded as evil devil women.Maybe as long as an artistic license is in play, we could possibly mention that the only thing that could bring a woman to kill her own child then *or* today would be mental illness. The women that were condemned to death in Salem and other places were just women. Just people with families that they loved. Just women with horrifyingly nasty neighbors and community members that allowed their own superstitious hysterics force the hanging or burning of innocent people.Why not mention that instead of writing asinine lines that equate infanticide as a satanic merit badge? Ug. The ghostly voice saying ""Look what she made me doooooo"" was a turn off.Okay I'm off my soap box.The writing is truly pathetic, but it is worth a rental if you can ignore the cave-dude Hayes Brothers momentarily- for the acting. I'm always a Lili Taylor fan, and she doesn't disappoint.Vera Farmiga and Ron Livingston carry the movie though. Farmiga was wardrobed into something of a puritan caricature, but she keels and swoons her way into a wonderful weirdness. Somehow, Livingston performs everything ""sideburns first"" and it's almost a parody, almost a laugh riot- but it is still okay. He still comes across as believable and you can take him seriously, even with his rather extreme beliefs and extreme sideburns. (That's more than can be said for the real Mr. Warren, anyway.)Wang's direction keeps it in the genre of horror instead of comedy. And it satisfies the basic expectations of a a horror movie, despite the distractions.It is a good basic scary movie, without an ounce of originality. The five teen and pre-teen girls (probably never once played Light as a Feather Stiff as a Board of course) could have slept with their covers on their feet. We all know that this has a guards and wards effect of being fully protected. But no. They left their little-girl ankles and piddies without covers or bed sheets- which hello! Exposes you to the evil demonic forces of darkness, people!! So.... the only thing to do in that situation would be to lean over the edge of the bed and look under it, of course.And then their bedroom door moves and there's a shadow? Or maybe something else?Awesome. Creepy. Great stuff. I mean, okay- this was the stuff that I scared the sheeot outta myself with when I was a kid. But what it lacks in originality is made up for with primal basics, I think. Get the popcorn out for a rental night, folks!",1464480000,"05 29, 2016"

The only two things decent about this movie were how people turned on superman because they knew it was safe to be mad at a guy that won't rip off their heads and Wonder woman. She was hardly in the movie but totally stole the show. Maybe because her character wasn't RE-FREAKING-INVENTED for the 20th time in less than 15years.At least they didn't have a cameo from the last iteration of the Joker, played by Jake whoever.

"Incredibly bad.  The only really interesting character, besides Hugh Jackman's Wolverine who makes a very brief appearance, is Olivia Munn's Psylocke, where we get very little of her on screen nor is there any character development.  Psylocke seems to have some remarkable martial arts theme going along that cool purple outfit, tied with her mutant power but we don't get enough of her nor do we see her range enough. They didn't even bother to get the 80's right!  Here this film had the chance to really knock one out of the park with that decade's awesome music, from Madonna, U2, Tina Turner, Annie Lennox, Run DMC, Duran Duran, all the way to Prince and Michael Jackson; yet NOT a single screen writer nor director bothered to take the super hero characters we all know and love down that lane!!! How pathetic to waste a great opportunity. The film starts out okay with a rebellion in ancient Egypt, from there it flies off into a large mess of a film.  Some sequences and scenes were okay, we see JLaw in an 80's sexy outfit when she infiltrates a fight den in East Berlin to seek out Nightcrawler.The ""Game of Thrones"" star who plays Jean Grey really is miscast, or plain doesn't fit the character well in comparison to Femke's original performance, and every other younger version of the character also just doesn't work.  The Moria McTaggert character to me is not interesting all, yet she gets a lot of screen time, and then some how they try to condense one of the major plot moving elements into this story by jamming in the ""Weapon X"" secret project mission in regards to Colonel Stryker which is non sensical and now has been retold to us for a third and different set up.  Yet in the end, we are left with exactly that ""Weapon X"" conspiracy military plot story as the ONLY thing interesting in this movie what so ever, even though the film is about fighting Apocalypse.  The character of Apocalypse is not intimidating at all, not very interesting, looks like a ""Power Rangers"" blue villain and not anything menacing, and then we have Magneto's character dragged through the emotional mud yet again just to turn him evil onto the world (only to later bring him back to goodness for the fifth or sixth time.)  Absolutely not interesting, recycled, and oh so boring. Hugh Jackman is the STAR of this franchise, period, NOT JLaw as awesome and as sexy as she is.  Mystique's character is a minor one in the cartoon, yet for what ever the reason because of Hollywood's obsession with ""Katness JLaw"", her character is made to be the most important.  This franchise's legitimacy doesn't work with out Jackman's Wolverine, he is so remarkable and awesome we as the true fans love his heroic character, we are on his side for he represents a brutalized military man who fights for freedom and unlike other campy heroes this guy goes straight out ""Rambo"" mode on his vicious enemies, slicing, beating, hacking, punching, and dicing ""no mercy"" rear end kicking style. Quicksilver is a good character, but having us believe he is Magneto's son for some reason doesn't come together as believable.  This film was badly written, the Army soldiers wear modern uniforms instead of the gear they would have worn in the 80's, not a single element other then Quicksilver's music choices do we see that this took place in the 80's for these producers didn't even bother to make the scenery look anything like the decade other then JLaw's cool outfits.  It looked like 2016.  And why the 80's at all?  If we are to take this story seriously as cannon, then Wolverine-Logan would have been converted in the Weapon X project and had been wondering with no memories from 83 all of those years until we reach the 21st Century to modern times.  Again just terrible writing and NO continuity. The film is a giant ""End of the Earth"", with trash and debris flying everywhere circus mess.",1464825600,"06 2, 2016"

I was pleasantly surprised.It is not worth the $17.99 it is still listed as, but it is worth a rental.  The cast of girls and the interaction with Rob Schneider makes for some amusing scenarios.The plot is not surprising, but it is not insulting - given the premise.  It doesn't bog down in lessons or morales. I was again surprised.If you are a Rob Schneider fan, you will enjoy it.  If you are not, but have been sucked into seeing Gigilo and Animal, this will offer a little forgiveness.",1089504000,"07 11, 2004"
"Universal's slickly produced ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" was the first of the monster pairings. This 1943 sequel remains a memorable showcase for Lon Chaney Jr.'s tragic werewolf  highlighted by excellent transformation sequences. Due to post-production tampering, Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster proved less effective (the studio eliminated all references to his blindness). Nevertheless, Bela has a priceless moment when the Monster displays a wicked smile after regaining his full power. The long-awaited ""rumble in the castle"" is a horror-movie classic. ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" may not represent great art, but it's nostalgic fun.",1208563200,"04 19, 2008"

"From Italy comes this four feature length episode series about Detective De Luca, an excellent change from English-speaking sleuths. What really sets this series apart is the time and place: Italy between the years 1938 and 1948, a time of chaos and upheaval, a time that encompassed the Second World War (1939-1945).Beginning in 1938, we find Detective De Luca working within a Facist state, under the firm dictatorship of il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was determined to restore Italy to the greatness of the Roman Empire, appealing to national pride much the same way Hitler appealed to a sense of national pride in Germany. Fascist Italy was allied to Hitlers Germany at this time in history though Italy stayed out of the conflict until the fall of France in 1940. Of Mussolinis invasion of France when they were most vulnerable, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said On this tenth day of June 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.Hence, beginning in 1940, Italy fought against Great Britain and her allies in Greece and both East and North Africa.This makes for a totally unique background for a detective series. Politics aside, Detective De Luca is a cop who won't take no for an answer as he strives for the truth no matter how ugly things get, even if it means defying his superiors. This is a classic good guy characteristic, of course, and it works in part because the scripts are intelligent, but primarily because actor Alessandro Prezioni, with his striking good looks (dark hair and piercing blue eyes) has immense appeal. Though handsome, he is also world-weary and barely has a penny to his name. What he does have, however, is a pronounced sense of honour and integrity. Audiences will root for that every time, no matter what language the hero speaks.By the time of the second episode, set in April 1945, De Luca is something of a celebrity in parts of Italy. Apparently he was in the right place at the right time and saved Mussolinis life on one occasion. He is welcomed in Bologna as a hero. It should be noted that by 1945, Italy was a country divided by civil war. Mussolini was a charismatic leader but not a good military strategist and even by1943, Italys dreams of Roman restoration were completely shattered, with Mussolini arrested by order of Italys King Victor Emmanuel III.The Germans rescued Mussolini and installed him in northern Italy, as leader of a puppet state, supported by Nazi occupation. Bologna is located is located in the north and was generally still sympathetic to Mussolini at the time of this episode, but fighting was always near at hand, and when the Germans pulled out, things became even more chaotic. It is around this period that episode two is situated. The burning question amid all the crime solving becomes, is De Luca really a Fascist?Episode three is set two months later, around the time of Mussolinis execution. Arguably the best of the four films, Cloudy Summer finds De Luca in the middle of a partisan mystery, where his fame as the man who saved Mussolini on one occasion is a death sentence. Set away from the city, this episode has a pastoral feel, with a goat playing a prominent role in the proceedings.Finally we are back in Bologna. It is now 1948 and De Luca says it best when he says I am neither Fascist or partisan: Im a cop. Im loyal to whoever allows me to do my job. Thus, ever the man on the outside, De Luca is inevitably facing pressure from within the ranks as well as the pressure to solve the crime. While his future as a policeman is up in the air it is possible he has finally found lasting love.DETECTIVE DE LUCA is an excellent police show with the added interest of its politically-charged setting, about which most people in North America will have limited knowledge.",1397433600,"04 14, 2014"

"A few hackneyed plot twists I can forgive, as long as the plot is lucid enough to keep them in an order that's pleasing to the eye. But ""In The Flesh"" crosses the line, throwing so many twists at us that are predictable and shallow, and ruin what could potentially pass as a good movie. But that, along with boring characters played by actors who seem to have little interest in the plot, drags the movie into the depths of a Blockbuster rental bin, to be looked at and passed over for something better.Don't let the twists fool you: the plot is simpler than the producers would have you think. It centers around closeted detective Philip Kirsch (Ed Corbin), who has been assigned to working a local gay bar, believed to be an underground drug ring. There, he trades many furtive glances with regular hustler Oliver (Dane Ritter), and the two hook up for a night.And wouldn't you know it, that big, hulking, macho cop Philip finds his soft spot once again? He follows Oliver around like a lost puppy, searching his medical files (isn't he a cop?), coming to his rescue as his alibi when Oliver becomes the prime suspect in a suspense-less murder case, and inviting him to live in his house until he finds a place of his own. But the real killer is still at large, and so are Oliver's less-than-interesting feelings of mistrust and inner torment.So what does all of this result in? A lot of frustration for the viewers, especially those of us who would like to see something, ANYTHING, happen to these characters of any interest. Oh, there are moments, ones that tease us, making us think something big is about it happen, but nothing comes of it.Take the relationship between the two leads, for example. Simple logic tells us that, in any independent gay film, if two men find themselves attracted to one another, then we will at least be granted the privilege of seeing some hot lip-locking. In ""In The Flesh,"" we get to see a gratuitous sex scene between a male and female, but not so much as a puckering of lips for our stumbling casanovas.If that isn't disappointing enough, the plot is a mess. It throws in secondary characters for its own convenience, such as Oliver's sister, who is a junkie that has become so dependant on narcotics that she will die without them. This provides an explanation for the drugs Philip finds in Oliver's belongings. One of Philip's cop buddies will play a role in the film's finale, in a contrived twist that seems desperate and tired.I don't know which of the characters I disliked more: the wooden, macho Philip, or hustler Oliver, the martyr of the movie whose several outbursts of emotional turmoil are more of an annoyance than a relatable feeling. The movie wants to be provocative in portraying how people builds emotional blocks when a catastrophic event traumatizes their lives, but it comes off as cheesy and unbelievable, and even actions the characters take reverse our emotions for them, even turning us against them.I wanted to like ""In the Flesh,"" because I enjoy movies that aren't afraid to take on gay subject matter. But that doesn't mean that every movie I see with this type of material is going to be an Oscar-worthy effort. In fact, this is one of the most emotionless attempts I've seen in a while. You have to give it credit as an independent film, for being a mark higher than other films, but everything in this movie is hit-or-miss, and what's going on in these characters' heads is anyone's guess.",1003017600,"10 14, 2001"

"I was introduced to these old films through Net-Flix, seeing ""Knives of the Avenger"" I then looked them up on Amazon being a sword & sorcery nut or nuts for any movie set in the era of the use of swords. After looking them up I discovered they are considered a sort of trilogy. They are all independent films with no relationship to each other, other than that fact that they are all starring Cameron Mitchell & are all three Viking movies. I don't know in what chronological order they were made, but in my opinion ""Erik the Conqueror"" is the best closely followed by ""Knives of the Avenger"" & then "" The Last of the Vikings"". None of these movies were ever made to win a Oscar, but they are all three great fun. I'm still waiting on ""Knives of the Avenger."" but so far ""Erik the Conqueror"" has received the best treatment as far as to the quality of digital restoration aspect ratio & general overall quality of the D.V.D. If your expecting to see a 50's, 60's type epic all star cast Technicolor extravaganza like ""The Vikings"" starring Kirk Douglas & Tony Curtis, you will be disappointed. However if your a fan of this genre & are looking to bulk up your collection all three of these movies are great escapist action period pieces. I give them five stars for what they are, fun fantasy adventure filmed on a low budget but with obvious love for the genre. The acting is adequate, the costumes & set's are like wise. The cinematography is exceptional and the story lines are believable and well paced. Being older film's although violent they are not overly graphic & could be enjoyed by the whole family on a rainy afternoon or cold winters night. If you are a critic with your blade at the ready to slice & dice don't bother, If your open to a little fun then snatch them up while they last at a affordable price! My ""Knives of the Avengers"" came today allowing me to discover their chronological order. 1st ""Erik the Conqueror"" also known as ""Fury of the Vikings"" & ""the Invaders"", 2cnd ""Last of the Vikings""& last but not least ""Knives of the Avenger"" also known as ""Viking Massacre"".",1373241600,"07 8, 2013"

"When sequels reach their third installment, it's more like nostalgia or tradition that makes me want to see it.  That's the case with American Wedding.  It doesn't live up to it's hilarious predecessors, but it's still a fun trip with the characters that you've come to enjoy.In this installment, Jim and Michelle plan their wedding, with just a little help from their friends.  What started out as a one-joke character in part one, Stiffler, returns as still a one-joke character.  In this instance, however, he is really over the top to the point that he was no longer funny.  Perhaps that was the intention, however, as it became clear that he was the only member of this cast who hasn't matured in the past four years.  It allowed room for him to grow, and he did, a little bit.While Stiffler is a negative in this film, the other characters were funny and charming as usual.  The storyline fit nicely into the trilogy and made for a fine conclusion.  Unfortunately, sequels are often compared to it's predecessors, and this one fails.  It lacks that one big scene the other two movies had and it lacked some of the sentimental storytelling as well.While I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, it's truly for the die-hard American Pie fans.",1075852800,"02 4, 2004"

"Political discussions between a U.S. ambassador and a Venezuelan foreign minister (btw, yes, it is absolutely necessary to have half naked women and champagne around when having such serious talks) are rudely interrupted by a school of overly-ferocious piranha. Sure, the boat they were on was in their turf (being the Amazon Websi...um... River), but our carnivorous friends don't jump the food chain directly to humans, as a rule.

"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.Recommended as a rental only.",1155340800,"08 12, 2006"
"""When they said you couldn't have your sperm back they robbed you of your future and you have every right to go take it back.""

I had pretty high expectations going in to this one and it's mostly my doing. I have been trying to watch movies without seeing the previews for them first in order to not have any preconceived ideas and I say the preview for this one a ton. I will admit that it was still really funny and worth watching but this is another movie where it seems like the funniest parts are in the previews. I'm not saying there are other funny parts because I did laugh throughout but overall I would have to say I was a little disappointed. This is still very much worth watching though.

"Saving Mr. Banks is the kind of film that Hollywood ought to love. It's about how one of the most beloved movies in movie history got made. And it's the first time Walt Disney has ever been portrayed in a movie, so that's saying a lot. And, just to put all of this perspective, when Disney first heard that the movie was being made, they're first reaction was to buy it and squash it. See, there's a reason Walt has never been portrayed onscreen before. However, after looking at it, they decided not only not to do that but to produce it! It's that kind of movie.And it's good. I mean, it's really good. I know it is because my wife cried through about the last third of it. I will be extremely surprised if it doesn't get the best picture Oscar this year. Overall, from what we've seen so far, I think it's most well rounded show out there. And it leaves you feeling good after having had a good cry.Not to get into what the movie is about, but it's about how Walt Disney convinced P. L. Travers to give him the rights to make Mary Poppins, something it took him 20 years to do. Along with that story, you see the story of the defining moment of Travers' childhood, which shows why Poppins was so important to her. From what I've seen from fact-checking, the movie is fairly accurate, which is another plus. A big one, actually. They did have hours and hours of audio recordings from sessions with Travers and some of the people working on the movie (because she insisted that everything be recorded), so they wouldn't have had a good excuse for it not being accurate.So, first, let's talk Tom Hanks. Oh, man, Tom Hanks was... incredible. There were moments, especially when they showed him watching himself on the old black and white TV show Walt introduced, where he was just like Disney. And, from everything I've read, Hanks did capture Walt to an amazing extent. I do know that the folks at Disney Studios shaved Hanks' mustache to the exact dimensions that Walt wore his. His only being called a supporting actor for this role, but I think it's a safe bet that he will at least get a nomination for it. I will not at all be surprised if he wins. Actually, I hope he does. [I haven't seen Captain Phillips, yet, but he's also being talked about for a best actor nomination for that one.]Then, we have to talk Emma Thompson, and she may just deserve best actress for her performance. That's a tough call for me, though, because Sandra Bullock carried an entire movie virtually by herself, and that's an impressive feat. However, I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off Travers the way Thompson did. It was a great performance, and she and Hanks were perfect together.Paul Giamatti was lovable as Ralph, the chauffeur. This role probably wasn't especially difficult for Giamatti, but he was perfect in it. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak were awesome as Richard and Robert Sherman. Not the parts called for too much, but it was great to see them in the movie. They were good, too. Especially this one part with Novak, but I don't want to spoil it, so you'll just have to see it; then, I'll tell you which one.Which brings us to Colin Farrell. Farrell is one of those underrated actors who is almost always excellent despite the horrible movies he's in. I mean, Alexander wasn't really his fault, and how can you blame him for not turning down Total Recall? At any rate, he's wonderful and wonderfully tragic as Travers Goff. He was my favorite part of the movie. I mentioned that my wife cried, but there were some scenes of Goff with his daughter where I almost cried. That's kind of saying a lot for me.I loved this movie. Of the possible best picture nominees, if you have to pick just one, this is the one I would recommend. Sure, Gravity is visually amazing, but this movie has heart that Gravity just doesn't have, no matter how you feel about Walt Disney. And let me make this clear, the movie is not about Walt Disney; the script was written (and not changed) before Disney (the Company) had a hand in it; the movie is about Travers and how she was ultimately convinced to allow Walt to make Mary Poppins into a movie. It's definitely worth seeing.",1389225600,"01 9, 2014"

"This movie was pretty cool, but I had higher expectations than the film delivered. I would have given the film 3.5 stars if the rating were avalible, but I decided to leave it at 3 rather than rounding up. My largest complaint would have to be the whole Zion Orgy/Sex Scene. What was this doing in here? It served no purpose other than to secure an R rating, and it was so dragged out that it cut into the the pacing of an already slow to start film. So basically, I don't see why it was in there to begin with. In the theater, I used the time the scene gave me to refill my popcorn. With the DVD, thankfully I can click the ""next chapter"" button. Much like the Enter the Matrix videogame wich launched similtaniousely, the movie has enough good points to justify putting up with the dissapointments, but it still fails to live up to the hype miserably (okay, ""Miserably"" is way to harsh a word to describe either of them, but it's all I can think of that sounds good). I still enjoyed the film quite a bit, but I think the Wachowski brothers got a bit too cocky from their sucsess with the first film, much like Rowland Emmeric and Dean Devlin with the steller Independence Day and the fun, but flawed Godzilla remake. A director's cut treatment with this DVD could have done marvels, provided that they trimmed out all the un-desirable material (read: ZION ORGY/SEX SCENE, amongst others) and improved the pacing, but it looks like the Wachowskis don't want to alter their ""masterpiece"" at all. But hey, we still get a second disc loaded with goodies, and if you really hate the film that much, you can always just watch the action scenes.",1061424000,"08 21, 2003"

"I didn't see this in the theater and it was a blind buy. I'm not going to pan this movie but for some reason it seems to be lacking something. Maybe it's because I wasn't able to really get into the people portraying the characters or maybe the movie just seemed like it was trying to find its bearings for the first hour and a half. Whatever it is, I'm finding myself compelled to sit and write this review on Amazon as the movie is playing in the background. My recommendation is to rent it first and not make it a blind buy unless you can get it for a really super price, say $5.

"Many times whilst watching this movie, I found myself wishing I was watching the much better 'Anne of the 1000 Days'. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is a travesty of a movie.Scarlett Johansen seemed to have the acting range of a cold, dead fish. Natalie Portman did better, but frankly, she was fighting a losing battle against very poor scripting. And Eric Bana...well, as an Aussie, I have of course taken the oath of allegience to always adore Eric Bana, who like Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest guys you could hope to meet. But Eric has a very strong accent, of the type that many people who hail from Melbourne's northern suburbs do, and he just can't seem to hide it, no matter what. When he tries to sound English, it just makes me cringe. I was almost expecting King Henry VIII to crack open a beer, throw another shrimp on the barbie and call Anne 'a beaut sheila'. Ugh! Sorry, Eric, you're a top bloke, but I can say with all honesty that Amy Winehouse would have made a better King of England, even with the problem of trying to get a crown on over the wig.The film made me angry because it was so historically inaccurate. No film better deserved to have the 'This movie is a work of fiction and bears no resemblance to any persons or events ever etc.' disclaimer appear in its closing credits. Worse, I sensed a strong bias from the writer (the writer of the book this was based on, assumedly), in that she seemed to be living vicariously through the character of Mary, and wanted her to be all things good, whilst her sister Anne had to appear as all things bad, assumedly to make Mary appear even better by comparison.And as for the scene with Anne and her brother (and anyone who's seen the movie will know exactly what scene I mean), well, that was just ICKY!I like my historical dramas to have at least some resemblance to actual history. And I like them to seem realistic and believable, not just like soap operas or bad romance novels, with inane dialogue and two-dimensional, illogically-constructed characters. I mean, in this movie, King Henry VIII is a thin, fairly stupid, silent and moody bloke who can be manipulated by the most transparent of women's wiles, who makes decisions on the merest hint of a whim, without a real thought of his own in his pretty little head. If King Henry VIII had been as much of a moron in real life as he was scripted to be in this movie, I doubt he would have survived beyond the cradle, let alone to become one of the most powerful, notorious, world-changing kings in history.Oh, and one final thing -- if you're going to spend nearly half a movie boring us viewers by showing women in bed either in labour or miscarrying, at least get the details right.

"There is no denying that Audrey Hepburn is a charming and endearing actress. Her singing on the other hand is less than phenomenal, so casting her in a musical (which was the big thing to do for a spell) was not the smartest decision to make. Casting her alongside the vocal talents of Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson only further embellished the fact that Hepburn was out of her league so-to-speak. The other problem with `Funny Face' is that even when you strip away the singing segments the story itself is average at best. This is your simple ugly duckling is made pretty and falls in love with the man responsible only to resent him and then fall back in love with him. This is the same formula we see in just about every film in this genre and its Oscar nomination in the writing department is almost as pointless as handing a film like `She's All That' a script nomination.In all honesty there is no imagination or originality to be found in `Funny Face'.The story follows bookworm Jo as she meets photographer Avery who thinks that she has the perfect face (albeit funny) for a new line of clothing for the everywoman. After some convincing is done Jo is shipped off to Paris where she is more interested in meeting Professor Emile Flostre than posing for pictures. Before long she falls head over heels for Avery, but his jealousy over the Flostre causes some issues to rise between he and Jo.Fred Astaire is, in my opinion, a little too old for the part. He looks uninterested most of the time, that is unless he is parading across the screen in full on sing and dance mode. Kay Thompson is delightful as Maggie Prescott. She is truly the greatest thing about the film and should have been up for Oscar since she is the only one in the cast who gets everything right. When she's singing, dancing or just plain acting she is spot on perfection. Astaire is only perfect when he's got a tune to whistle, and Audrey is stunning when she's merely reading lines, but once the music starts she comes off out of place. Her voice is not terrible, but it is not up to par with her co-stars.I can't really say that I would ever watch `Funny Face' again. Aside from Thompson I was let down for the overall experience was less that it could have been. The plot was simple at best and the dialog didn't help the matter too much either. Hepburn is charming and Astaire can sing and Thompson was splendid but the mediocre outweighs the positive and brings this film down a few notches for me.Not everything can be a classic.",1339027200,"06 7, 2012"

"I've said it before in my reviews and I'll say it again here, don't get your history from Hollywood.  Hollywood is in the entertainment business and not the education field.  The Red Baron is a classic example of a movie that is allegedly based on fact.  The fact that this movie wasn't even made in Hollywood doesn't change the fact that is meant for entertainment purposes only.  This film is loosely based on Manfred VPN Richtoven's amazing life as a World War One flying ace, but that is about where fact leaves off and fiction begins.Von Richtoven is depicted in this movie as a caring noble pilot who seems more a victim of circumstance rather than the calculating killer he really was.  When I say calculating killer I do not mean to further the myth of imperial German militarism or make the Germans to be the bloodthirtsty monsters history has labeled them.  Instead I mean that von Richtoven had one choice when in the air, shoot down others before they shot him down.  The life expectancy of a First World War pilot was measured in days, not months or years.  The fact that Von Richtoven lasted as long as he did is testimony to his ability to kill when he needed to kill.  This movie fails completely to put him in that kind of context.  Rather it makes him to be a celebrity (which he was) making the best of a bad situation (which he probably did) while trying to be compassionate (which he wasn't).I give this film three stars not because of the storyline, which is weak, or the acting, which is mediocre, but because of the aerial dogfight scenes, which as quite entertaining.  The fight scenes puts the perspective of the pilots in context for those of us who were not there.  Compared to The Blue Max, The Red Baron shows how technology has changed so that virtually anything is possible with special effects.  For the fight scenes alone this movie is worth watching, especially if you watch it on Netflix.  I do not recommend buying it, there are too many reasons not to.  But watch it and you will appreciate what the pilots went through.  Then you may begin to realise how difficult their role was.  Then, if you are intrigued to learn more, get a book on the Red Baron or the air war in general.This movie is a German production that was done in English.  I've read that the intent was to tap the American market.  Unfortunately for the film's producers, there is little such market even if the main character is portrayed as the king of person we would relate with.  The net result was an indifferent American audience and an uncaring German audience.  Perhaps the producers learned one of those counterintuitive lesson, how not to make a movie.",1332633600,"03 25, 2012"
"This past year has proved to be a banner year for Genesis. With a smash reunion of the three parts that have defined the group as one, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks coming together as one in nearly 15 years. There massive performace all across Europe and the U.S. really did a great service of reminding how potent and strong their music has still delivered over the years. Not only by their performances, but with the recent re-release of their albums like Invisible Touch, We Can't Dance, and Duke to just name a few. But, when Live In Rome came out, it really delivered a cavalcade of classic Genesis songs that are strong and proof of merit. But, back in 1986, Genesis proved that theory with a big performance, but on video that is just a sad land of confusion.Genesis: Live At Wembley Stadium, is a showcase of one of their biggest concerts of that era. The video shows Phil and company performing songs from their Invisble Touch album, which basically is most of the DVD alone. The songs have been remastered well within the performance, as you hear classic songs like Throwing It All Away, the haunting Domino Parts 1 & 2, and the deep and driven Mama. While the performance is good, I really don't hear a lot more than mainly their 80's songs on this DVD. I really find it a bit dissapointing that they did not perform great classics Genesis has been known for like Afterglow, Abacab, and Duchess. That alone leaves a bit of a weakness. The extras don't also bring in too much to make up for the flubs, by showing a documentary about the tour, and a photo gallery.All in all, I was hoping that Genesis: Live At Wembley Stadium could've brought down the house heart and soul for many hard core fans. It still misses the mark with better live DVD's like the recently released When It Rome, which sadly is only available at Wal-Mart, or Phil Collins 2004 Final Farewell Tour DVD showed. Still, if you haven't heard any of the Genesis greats' of the 80's era, than this is one you'll say In Too Deep too.DVD Cover: BRemastering: C+Extras: CPrice: C 1/2+Performance: C+Overall: C",1220659200,"09 6, 2008"
"2 Stars for the Blu-Ray - wow; I have seen and enjoyed many blu-rays, DVD's, LaserDisc, VHS and other movie media - this is one of the worst transfers I've seen. To the point where I almost question the authenticity. The DVD had good 5.1 surround, the blu-ray used a mediocre mix at best. The video transfer is blocky and overly bright.4 Stars for the movie - I know a lot of folks won't agree with me. But this movie takes me back to the old Wing Commander video games. It will never win any award, but its a sci-fi made for the big screen with some decent fun. Pay no attention to any of the science or the fact that they hear things in space.... vacuum of space only applies for certain plot needs in this movie.Bottom line - you will not get a Blu-Ray level picture or sound from this movie, which is to bad because it did have some good sound and video in the theater.",1434844800,"06 21, 2015"
"Have you ever witnessed (no, not seeing a video with little perspective) of a fast moving freight train hitting a vehicle?  I have long ago while working for the Union Pacific;  I was working for the U.P. and sitting trackside on a ""ballast machine"" knowing that the freight was about to come thru....thus making it requisite to pull into a siding which was there for such purposes.  A truck driverwith suicide on his mind pulled onto the tracks just as the freight was approaching.  Yes, there is debris flying through the air ahead of the impact area but any normal freight (75 to 100+ cars) will just slice right through the vehicle....there is no threat of a derailment under normal circumstances (such as an improperly maintained trackage) and will continue to pass through while the engineer attempts to stop the train.  It is a horrendous event to witness (the driver was killed immediately) but something with the tonnage of a freight train is not going to go flying in all directions.  J.J. Abrams has a wild imagination as shown in his earlier works....but the premise of a derailment is simply ridiculous.  And be prepared to describe the events before a Coroner's Jury!

"Paramount has totally let true fans of classic television down with this much-anticipated release.  Due to music issues, a handful of episodes (4 or so) have some original broadcast scenes deleted!  This is completely unacceptable.  They could have changed the music (which is bad enough in my opinion), but to delete the scene entirely is ridiculous!  As much as I loved this show, I can't bring myself to support this set.To add insult to injury, they still used the word ""complete"" on the cover!  I've noticed in some upcoming Paramount releases that this word is suddenly missing.  Check out the cover art for ""Happy Days"" Season Two and ""Wings"" Season Four.  This leads us to wonder, are these shows truly complete, or will they suffer a fate similar to that of ""Family Ties""?As much as I've always despised music alterations, I've still bought DVD sets that used that tactic since the shows otherwise contained all of the original broadcast footage.  But I will NOT buy a set that just hacks away at the episodes like this.  If we do support these products, the studios will just keep getting lazier and lazier.  Why should they care about putting work into their releases if the public will still gobble up whatever garbage they put out?I really hate this, because I was looking SO forward to finally owning what I thought was going to be the complete and uncut version of each episode.

"If you want to watch a moderately clever (and somewhat self-ridiculing) movie based upon motifs taken from Japan, or the lifestyle of the Japanese, you may indulge in this.  But for a person, like myself, who has lived many years in Japan and reveres what is unique, transcendent and life-changing about this amazing country, this film is not only nothing like Japan, but it is an all out slur against it's natives and culture.  Nothing in this film resembles the real Japanese life or the true overall spirit of the Nihonjin people.  Please, if you want a Japanese movie that captures their best and their Oriental spirituality, look rather to ""Cherry Blossoms"" or the recent ""Departures"" (English version of the title).  What sickens me most about this movie, one that I had had high hopes for, is it's senseless and useless violence.  Violence against innocents, but also violence of the spirit.

"We started to watch McClintock, and the movie started out as wide screen, but the film, itself, turns out to be letter mode.This looks like it was recorded off of someone's cheap TV set. There is no quality like a real DVD, from the manufacturer, is. The picture is grainy and lines run, horizontally, through it.This was a huge disappointment since I had bought it for one of my husband's Valentine presents. We are keeping it because the shipping costs more than it's worth.Lesson learned not to buy used from people, who don't have 100% feedback.The extra star is for the shipping since it came really fast.",1423872000,"02 14, 2015"

"aspects of this film are brilliant - the way sound and camera work to produce a churning sense of disorientation really affected me, and i guess that's the point in a world where we can imagine there is little we have not seen.  there were parts of this film i could not watch, and the commentary in these reviews about the ability to ""handle"" the violence is pretty childish - or reflects the same impulse of sadistic machismo that drives the film.  my sense was that this was an intensely personal portrait of rage, and it took me places i really did not want to go. the film uses a range of techniques to encode realism, which is not to say that the film is any more real than what hollywood produces.  to cite the rape in the film as ""realistic"" is beside the point - it is graphic and horrifying, which rape is, but within a mediaculture which increasingly eroticises rape it would be a mistake to imagine that this film provides the ""authentic"" version (and thus some rapes really are erotic). this is a haunting and unpalatable film, and it saddens me that some viewers think their ability to consume this imagery is noble or clever.",1063497600,"09 14, 2003"
"I realize this is a ""toning"" video, but usually there's a little bit of cardio thrown in there.  Cause let's face it, you have to get the heart rate up to burn off fat and calories so you can see the muscle.  But there is zero cardio in this.  Kendall is highly annoying as well.  I didn't find it particularly hard either - he says a couple of times about fatiguing the muscle to get them sculpted, but even with heavier dumbbells, fatigue didn't happen.  There is also ZERO ab work in this, so I can't call it ""total"" resculpt. It wasn't totally worthless...the upper body segment was ok I guess.  But the lower body wasn't a workout at all.

"How this film got to be a ""video nasty"" in the UK I will never know...it's one of the most dire and dreary excuses for ""entertainment"" I have ever seen. The plot centres around the kidnapping of a glamorous actress, who is hauled off to some remote island while her captors send off their ransom demands. The actress's father (or whoever) dispatches two mercenaries to collect the girl. Arriving on the island they try to outwit the kidnappers and save the girl. This is all very boring, so to liven things up, the film gives us a tribe of natives who are minding their own business and sacrificing young maidens regularly to a hideous mutant person who like to attack his victims and eat their skin off. I'm sure you can guess the rest.Even if that was an interesting plot, the film manages to bungle absolutely everything. If you've ever seen any European cannibal shockers from the 1980's before, you might be hoping for some gory thrills, but there's nothing like that here. Because this is a Jess Franco film, all the nudity is upped, and everything else is botched. All we have are cheap shoddy effects, dreadful acting and terrible dubbing. Here's a quick checklist of the crud you're going to have to put up with if you choose to sit through this:1. A tribe of natives who look like a rounded up bunch of staff from the local bars, kitted out with with loincloths and pointy sticks. There isn't even a token nod to trying to assemble people with a similar ethnic background to make up this so called ""lost tribe"".2. A prowling monster who turns out to be a tall black guy with two crusty ping bong balls stuck over his eyes. He also ""eats"" skin in a way you would only do while being filmed in close-up for shock effect...i.e with his mouth wide open so that everything falls out of it all the time...can't be that hungry, then?3. A lead villain with an atrocious plummy British accent and who also has no idea how to make an exchange of hostage for cash - he messes it up every time!4. Fake blood that looks like glue - it actually hangs down in rubbery strings!5. Typical cheap sensationalism by having the women naked or topless almost all the time (ok I know some people are not going to complain about that). But I'd like to know how men can rape through a skirt and with their trousers still on.6. Editing so bad that you won't know what's going on most of the time - check out the climactic fight. I had to watch it twice to work out what happened (How did that stick get there? What's he standing on? How did he fall over that cliff?).7. A ""bail out"" from a flying helicopter that clearly shows that the helicopter is actually on the ground.8. Truly excruciating dialogue:Reporter: ""Could you give me an opinion of the men in our country?""Actress (while pulling ridiculous Jan Brady-esque modelling poses): ""I have no opinion of men - I just love them!""Mercenary (after being asked to hand over the cash): ""There's no deal unless you bring the girl with you and come un-armed"".Kidnapper: ""Ok, as you wish!"" (Erm, never done this before, pal?)Naked girl at the mercy of two mercenaries with guns: ""When the tribe catches a young girl, they sacrifice her to their god, who eats her heart!""Mercenary: ""Rest now and don't worry about it"".Naked girl: ""Thank you!"" (she then immediately falls asleep).7. Plus a hundred other things.It's all absolute trash. Be glad someone else has sat through this so you don't have to.",1235952000,"03 2, 2009"
"""Sidewalks of New York"" (1931) was Buster Keaton's biggest box-office hit, even though the comic genius detested the MGM production. Despite his lack of creative control, Keaton manages some brilliant moments in this early talkie - a precursor to the antics of the Dead End Kids. Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards makes a better Keaton sidekick than Jimmy Durante. No match for Buster's silent classics, but more enjoyable than ""Free and Easy"" and ""What! No Beer?""

"I'm really surprised at the high reviews.On the positive side, IRIA has some interesting character design and atypical elements of science fantasy. Plus the DVD is about 180 minutes long.On the negative, IRIA is unengaging and more action than story or character based. I found myself bored, and quickly not caring what was going on.There's nothing particularly special about the animation, though it does feature some nicer background paintings. Hold frames of IRIA are drawn better than most. IRIA pales in comparison to GHOST IN THE SHELL, ARMITAGE III, NINJA SCROLL, GIANT ROBO, and even THE BIG O, in my opinion.A rental, at best.",1008374400,"12 15, 2001"
"THE WICKEDI love movies about witches but for some reason there are very few of them that actually are out there compared to the other creatures and monsters of legend. From the movies that have been made some are good, most are ok, few are classics. This movie falls short of that classic status but it is a good flick. Sure it kinda falls into that teen scream kinda thing but it really is creepy at times. Kids in particular would be truly scared of this.""The Wicked"" is a local legend that kids pass amongst each other and parents tell to make them go to bed. Well in this town it may be a little more than legend.  Young girl goes missing apparently taken straight out of her bedroom in the middle of the night. The town officials are on the hunt for a kidnapper but there are some who believe that something more sinister is at work here. Enter your typical teenagers who are planning a nice ""wholesome"" night out in the woods. Once there they may stumble upon something dark out in a house. A house that if you throw a rock and break a window something ""Wicked"" this way comes.This is one of those movies that would have been really great with a bigger budget. I say that because this movie actually is not that bad, in fact I liked it. I have always been about the legend movies plus like I mentioned witch films. Speaking of the witch I really liked what they did with her. He looked very creepy and may be the absolute best part of the film. Also for a low budget flick this movie looked good and had some decent acting in it as well.Of course this is not a perfect flick as some of the characters can be annoying at times. I guess that makes sense since it is a bunch of teens. I have to say that I did like the two younger teens who were childhood friends becoming something more than that. I felt they both did a good job here, the girl in particular. As far as the older teens they were good as well but the characters were like I said kind of annoying. Also the little girl who was taken was very very good in this; I really believed that she was terrified.This film was directed by Peter Winther who you may know as a producer on films like ""Stargate"", ""Independence Day"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Patriot"", and ""Eight Legged Freaks"". I can tell that this guy has some true potential as a director. The opening scene in particular was excellent. I also liked the writer here as he wrote the film ""Warriors of Virtue"" and directed the second one. Of course both guys could have done a better job here but overall it was an enjoyable movie. Actually a group of us went over to my grandmother's house a few weeks ago and watched this; she is very much into horror films.pretty good horror",1369267200,"05 23, 2013"
"Rather than spending $20 (cost of the DVD, shipping & tax), save your money and spend it at the 99 Cent Only store.

It was more like the Sci-Fi Channel gone awry...horrible acting...horrible script...horrible soundtrack...and the special effects reminded me of movies from the 50s.

"The Kino DVD of the newly restored version is in picture box.  Really a dumb move.  The picture is so small you can hardly see it.About the movie itself, Dr. Caligari killed the first man who humiliated him at the office.  Then Alan was killed by his friend when he believed the girl loved Alan. (more than him) So these two murders are mysteries and donot involve Cesare.  The girl was not killed by Cesare thus proving he could not kill in a hypnotized state.  I have come to be suspicious of the murnau stiftung restorations.

"FIRST OFF, THIS DVD IS CIA DISINFORMATION. This dvd should be noted for what it doesn't mention, not what it does. There is a scene where a laser is used to line up the shot that hit JFK in the back. It goes on to say that the laser also lines up with John Connely's back so the ""single bullet theory""--sorry, make that ""single bullet FRAUD"", is possible. WHAT THEY FAIL TO MENTION IS THAT BULLET WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ENTERED JFK'S BACK COMING DOWN FROM A 6TH FLOOR WINDOW AND EXITED HIS THROAT. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE THE WARREN COMMISSION's FRAUDULANT BALISTICS FALLS APART. A BULLET TRAVELING DOWN IS NOT GOING TO ENTER OVER 5 INCHES DOWN FROM A SHIRT AND JACKET COLLAR AND EXIT A THROAT. NOT EVEN MENTIONING THAT ALL THE DOCTORS AT PARKLAND HOSPITAL SAID JFK'S THROAT WOUND WAS A SMALL PERFECTLY ROUND HOLE--AN ENTRANCE WOUND.  The dvd also points out that you can see a spray of blood going forward from JFK's head on the Nix film. NO MENTION OF THE ""HARPER FRAGMENT""; THE OCCIPITAL BONE FOUND IN THE STREET BY BILLY HARPER. THE OCCIPITAL BONE IS THE BACK AND BOTTOM BONE ON YOUR SKULL JUST WHERE YOUR NECK MEETS YOUR SKULL. IT FLEW OUT, BACK AND TO JFK'S LEFT AS DID THE BLOOD & BRAIN MATTER THAT SOAKED THE MOTORCYCLE COP JUST BEHIND MRS. KENNEDY.

"Think to yourself: how easy would it be in your middle age to: 1) lose your career, 2) find another viable career to pursue, 3) pursue said ""career"" by heading to college which brings exquisite debt, 4) and let's not forget then facing the task of finding a JOB in this ""career"" ...all while worrying about keeping a roof over you and your family's head? And thankfully, the movie industry has brought you ""Larry Crowne"" which wraps-up a plan just like this in just over an hour and a half!My main gripe with films like this is that the underlying message is anything but ""inspiring"" or ""up-lifting."" Rather, the message is that ONE guy manages to revamp his entire life and in the process, ""makes it"" with a bony woman who takes her fortunate job as a college professor completely for granted in the most caustic, unfunny fashion. Can you make a fresh start by going to college? Absolutely, but it's a start that is anything but ""fresh"" when you're faced with the debt afterwards. This was just another propaganda, ""kick-in-the-pants"" flick in which someone magically switches gears later in life and stumbles into an unlikely romance... while being poor and riding a scooter? I honestly have no idea how hollywood execs green-light this crap.Some would say ""that's the magic of hollywood,"" but when you consider that Hanks wrote this and used his college time as inspiration, is it really that ""magical?"" By the same token, a real life story of someone who goes from rags to riches isn't terribly ""magical"" because they're 1 in several hundred million that accomplish it.Anyway, commercials for this film made it look like a lighthearted rom-com, which if you can choose to be gullible enough to buy-in to the industry created by crippling student loans, then laugh away at ""Larry Crowne."" When also weighing Julia Roberts' unlikable character and her offensively-rude treatment of students, this qualifies as a 5-star job in the ""Candy-Coated Crap"" genre of film mak",1428019200,"04 3, 2015"
"All the succeeding versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers have been weaker than the ones which came before, but they've all had interesting additions to the basic story of the pods taking over people.The original (1956 with Kevin McCarthy) was the best because it was a low-budget film noir that didn't take itself too seriously. The Philip Kaufman remake in 1978 set in San Francisco anticipated the AIDS/STD crisis that was just around the corner. Abel Ferrara's version Body Snatchers (1993), set on an Army post, gave us a look at what happens when a society is increasingly militarized without wide scale involvement in the military by civilians for a temporary term of service, the way Americans experienced World War II.The Invasion starring Nicole Kidman is the least interesting yet, but even it has a couple of intriguing ideas. I get the feeling it was intended to say some halfway serious things about the United States and its place in the world before a glamorous movie star got involved.Pills have replaced pods in this version of the story.Psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman) prescribes a change in medication when a woman in an abusive marriage reports that her husband has become much calmer, except for strangling the dog when it growled at him.Later one of the newly infected asks Bennell if she can give him a pill to prevent a Darfur, or a New Orleans.Before the alien infection arrives on Earth, Bennell is caught between her ex-husband and her platonic boyfriend. We see both men before and after they're infected. Unlike previous versions of the story, people aren't killed and replaced by duplicates grown from pods, they are just transformed by an infection into a joint human-alien entity.These monsters aren't the emotionless pods of previous invasions. One old man, after he's transformed, comes back to his wife and begs her to join him. His desire for the woman he's loved for decades seems real.Bennell's ex-husband is a jerk before and after he's infected, and her boyfriend is the same calm rational man he was before. This invasion of the body snatchers doesn't really result in losing your identity. The peace that breaks out all over the world is almost as ludicrous as in the 1952 B movie with Peter Graves,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Planet-Mars/dp/B000G28GHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Planet Mars</a>, when God speaks from Mars.I think the people who conceived this film wanted us to consider that maybe we should allow the infection to change us.There's one moment at the climax, when it looks like Bennell and her son (who's immune to the infection) can't escape, when she considers surrendering. But they won't allow her immune son to survive and risk the new order. So she blasts away.It's no surprise that salvation comes from Fort Detrick, where the scientists have been working on a drug (of course!) to reverse the infection.The world goes back to normal, but the movie doesn't tell us that the scientists at Fort Detrick have kept a sample of the alien substance and are working on a way to turn it into a weapon. If that's the sequel to this movie, it may be the most honest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers yet.",1264550400,"01 27, 2010"

"The acting seemed to me to be ""mailed in"". I really like both of the actors in this movie. And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check. That's all.",1300147200,"03 15, 2011"

"Watchable, fairly explicit ""art house"" style erotic drama about an attractive young man and woman engaged in a one-night stand.  Taking place entirely in their motel room, the man and woman are first fairly cool and nonchalant about their mutually agreed upon liaison, but then eventually open up to each other about several issues on their minds, sexual and otherwise.  There are three or four sex scenes throughout the film (hey, the characters are young), with the extended conversation scenes taking place between those scenes.  A revelation or two, while not shocking, are dramatic enough to add a layer of interest to the proceedings.The extra features are few in number and short in running time, but they give a reasonable, interesting glimpse into the world of the film. A couple of interview clips illuminate the motivations of the director and actors.  Clips from awards shows indicate that at least a few people in Chile (the film's country of origin) regard ""En La Cama"" highly.  My favorite special feature was a bonus short film, about two or three minutes long, that perhaps concisely sums up the state of many relationships out there.  At the least, it's clever and moving.If you're looking for outright erotica and nothing else, then you might want to pass up ""En La Cama"", as the talking scenes will probably frustrate you.  But if you're open to erotic movies that also incorporate other aspects of the human experience, you might get some modest enjoyment out of this DVD, as I did.",1228089600,"12 1, 2008"

"Howdy Doody, one of the most beloved and cherished icons of all time, entertained children of all ages for 13 glorious years on television, beginning back in 1947 and ending in 1960.  This special 5 disc collection highlights 40 memorable episodes from this beloved series, including a bonus disc with 3 additional episodes, including the final show in color.  Join Howdy and the gang, along with Buffalo Bob Smith, Chief Thunderhud, Princess Winterspring Summerfall, and the always funny and mischievous Clarabell the Clown, as they take us on a wonderful journey back to a more innocent time when commercials were a part of the show, everything was in black & white, and children everywhere believe in a cute little wooden guy named Howdy.The video and audio quality is pretty good, considering how old the material is.  Not perfectly clear and crisp, of course, but certainly not so bad that it really detracts from the enjoyment of the show.  You get 10 episodes on each of the first 4 discs, with each episode running nearly 30 minutes each.  Three additional episodes are included on the 5th Bonus disc, including the memorable final episode, along with additional extras.Perhaps the only real criticism is that all 5 discs are stored in paper sleeves inside the box set, which may cause the discs to fall out or be scratched if handled too harshly.  The box and bonus photo album booklet is a very nice touch though.

"It was hard to know how to rate this.  I liked it but didn't think it warranted a 4 star but I can't give it a 3.5 stars so this was more accurate.  I bought this based on the other ratings that I saw posted.  It is difficult to do a docudrama.  I do appreciate the folks here giving it a shot as I think Christian history is important.George Muller is probably not as well known as others and it could be because his legacy did not endure.  The orphanages he started are now private flats & part of the college, no longer are they orphanages.  But hearing his name in certain circles, I was curious about this movie.WHAT I LIKED:- Good costumes- Decent acting- An uplifting storyWHAT I DIDN""T LIKE:- A bit long drawn at times- Brief history, no real details- Extra footage didn't really focus on MullerI think what tips me more in to the 3 star rather than the 4 star is that the movie almost felt like a message which today can be dangerous.  If you dream it, it will happen.  I understand the importance of prayer and reliance on God.  But this movie made it seem as if you pray hard enough, have enough faith that anything can happen which isn't true.  God answers our prayers in 3 ways:  Yes, No, Later.  And we don't always get what we pray for and it isn't a indication of faith or our love for God.In the end I wasn't won over by the story, storyline or the history of George Muller.  I don't think I will be watching this one again.",1418083200,"12 9, 2014"
"I should have realized the price was too good to be true. This was not at all as advertised: came on 1 dvd9 format disk, no box, just a plastic sleeve. Chinese subtitles were clearly visible in the background and the ""Subtitles by MBC"" that appears online was conspicuously absent. After the 10th episode, the English subtitles turned to jibberish: sentence fragments, misspelled words, no capitalization or punctuation. To make things worse, the character names all reverted to Chinese spellings. I couldn't tell who was who. Someone obviously recorded this off of Hong Kong tv and did their own subtitles. Too bad they didn't speak English. Spend the money and get the ""MBC licensed"" or ""Official US"" version. This is an excellent drama, just don't buy this copy.",1318464000,"10 13, 2011"

"This movie is frustrating to watch. There are so many characters that it should have provided viewers with a complementary roster. Also, the British accents get in the way of American comprehension.

"Syndicated radio host and former BET Comic View host Rickey Smiley brings his outrageously comedic antics and impersonations full circle in Kingdom Comedy, the latest entry in the gospel comedy genre.  He brings Dean Edwards (Saturday Night Live), Todd Lynn (My Wife and Kids), Marc Theobald (Def Comedy Jam) and Marc Younger (Last Comic Standing) along for the ride.  Ranging from subjects like church, race & gender differences and raising kids, this is a definite hit that the entire family can enjoy for 2 hours and 4 minutes.  With extras including two extra Rickey Smiley comedy routines, a Rickey Smiley interview (which is divided into several commentaries in between acts) and a music performance from a rising Stellar award-nominated gospel songstress, the runtime is between 2 1/2 and 3 hours.  This DVD is a definite must-have alongside Holla!-The Gospel Comedy Hour and Sinbad's HBO comedy specials.  I hope that he'll release another volume.  What are you waiting for?  Go ahead, buy this and plan a family night laughing at Rickey Smiley & Co. delivering the best in good clean gospel comedy.",1210204800,"05 8, 2008"

"I recently went back and watched Star Trek Generations on this special collector's edition. The film was a lot more entertaining that I had remembered but it is not without its flaws.The movie was made to bring together the two captains and to kill off our beloved Captain Kirk. It opens with a fast paced and action packed sequence where Kirk is killed saving the newest Enterprise while on a short cruise. We are then introduced to the Next Generation through a fun but somewhat contrived holodeck scene. Picard receives disturbing news and makes him reflect on his life, Data experiments with an emotion chip and a madman is destroying stars for a selfish purpose.When you add all of this together, we have a very entertaining and at times a visually stunning movie. The movie moves along at a brisk pace and we are never once bored. The special effects, especially the crash scene, are very good and the theme of time is very well done.Despite being entertained, I found the movie to be very uneven. While I was amused at Data's trials of experiencing emotions, the subplot felt very out of place. The ""echo"" of Guinan seemed a little too convenient and when we get the two captains together, we just get a long fist fight. It made the entire ""two captains, one destiny"" concept feel a little empty.The DVD transfer is very good. The colors were crisp and the picture quality was superior. The extras while plentiful were kind of bland. Most of the extras deal with the location of the planet where a 1/4 of the movie takes place and it just isn't very interesting. The crash segment was covered but it was much too limited to one part of the filming and not the entire sequence itself. And the deleted scenes are not interesting at all, mainly due to being VERY rough cuts.I have actually increased my rating for Generations because it is entertaining and rates way above Star Trek V and the abysmal continuity killing Nemesis. It is a film that is more about time and how it stalks us and reminds us to seize the moment and on that level is succeeds.",1115596800,"05 9, 2005"

This documentary had about 15 minutes worth of somewhat interesting material crammed into an hour or so (I didn't make it to the end) of feature length. At least 1/3 of the coverage was about the fact that these deception specialists were mostly artists and they spent much of their idle time (apparently considerable) sketching whatever was in front of them.

"For months before it's release word (probably fueled by George Lucas himself) was that Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones would be a much more satisfying sequel than that mess that was Star Wars Episisode I:  The Phantom Menace.  George Lucas has no imagination left.  Can I back that claim up?  Absolutely.  One of the most exciting scenes of The Empire Strikes Back was of course the asteroid field sequence in which the Millenium Falcon dashes in and out of asteroids to escape T.I.E. fighters in pursuit.  This movie also gives a chase in an asteroid field but this time it's about as exciting as looking over the shoulder of someone playing a video game.  Another scene that plays as a video game is a scene in which Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) fight these over sized hornets in a droid factory.  Remeber that Activision game Pitfall?  It's like a space age version of that game.  Oh, and remember towards the end of TESB Darth Vader cuts Luke Skywalker's hand off and in the final scene Luke is scene with a mechanical hand?  This time out Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) cuts Anakin's arm off and Anakin has a mechanical arm in the final scene.  Those are minor irritations next to the main thing wrong with this movie.  Anakin.  He's a horrible character.  The child Anakin was annoying in TPM and he's even worse as a young adult.  He whines all the time.  Whether he thinks he's being treating unfairy by Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) or he's telling Padme how much he loves her, he just whines.  The movie is painful to watch whenever Hayden Christensen is on screen.  The love story between Padma and Anakin is possibly one of the worse love stories in cinema history.  It feels forced and contrived.  At first Anakin keeps telling Padme how he has thought of her every night for over ten years...he seems as one of the stalkers from There's Something About Mary.  Then he loses his mom in a ridiculous scene, and takes his revenge on those pesky Tuskin Raiders.  Afterwards in the worst scene of the film he confesses to Padma what he had done.  The guy is suppose to be a Jedi but he's turning into a psychotic.  Padme soon is totally in love with him.  That doesn't say too much for her judgement.  By the way, the scene in which Anakin murders the Tuskin Raiders is so brief it seems it was edited to get this movie a PG rating that George Lucas longs for.  Enough negative thoughts.  The movie is kind of entertaining while Ewan McGregor is on screen.  The scene at the clone factories is one of the best in the movie.  Christopher Lee gives a good turn as Count Dooki (what a stupid name for a character).  And like Phantom Menace, the special effects are terrific.  The final ground battle is also amazing.  I was not a big fan of the showdown between Dooku and Yoda.  Before Lightsabers are whipped out and Yoda is reflecting Dooku's assaults, I was thinking, this is Escape From Witch Mountain.  To sad thing is these two latest Star Wars flicks could have been decent, if someone other than George Lucas had written and directed them.",1056758400,"06 28, 2003"

"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass, but interesting for anyone who remembers ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" growing up...",1316649600,"09 22, 2011"

"I ordered this DVD from Target, and too late discovered that ""The Complete First Season"" means just that, but ""The Complete First Season - Disk 1"" (this DVD) means you get seven episodes out of the first season.  I didn't notice the difference until I opened the DVD.  Since there is no ""Complete First Season - Disk Two"" out there, I will need to purchase the other DVD to get all of the episodes.  What a waste of money.  Part of this is my fault, I should have read the discription, but part of this feels like Warners is trying to put one over on the customer.  They released the entire first season in 2004, and in 2007 released these seven episodes with the same cover and nearly the same title.  Easy to confuse the two, and Warners Home Videos profits from the confusion.",1231545600,"01 10, 2009"

"Forgetting the fact that it feels a little like a Stargate rip, this show was much better than I expected.  The plotlines were more sophisticated, the CG more adventurous, and the characters were more appealing.  It's like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Stargate SG1.  Being a television series, heavily laden with CG, that, while good enough for broadcast, probably wouldn't hold up on a large screen, I watched the Blu-rays on a modest 52"" 1080p in our living room, instead of in the dedicated HT.  At that size, it generally looked great, and the CG was believable enough, though use of green screens became more obvious in massion interiors, forsaking the illusion to some degree.  Still, overall, the shows ambition was worth a look.The studio includes both lossless surround as well as basic stereo, which usually provides better clarity for people without surround sound, as downmixing in many players can be degrading, if not deleterious.  And intelligibility of the stereo mix was excellent.  There's a redundant DD 5.1 mix included as well, which is completely uneccessary as DTS HD includes an even better lossy core that every BD player should be able to extract. Having auditioned the show in our living room instead of our HT, I won't comment on either surround mix.  I would like to caution about the packaging though.  E1 has chosen a cheap cardboard and plastic packaging solution that's rather annoying to use, as two of the discs are stacked atop the others, meaning you have to remove disc 1 to get to disc 2 and you have to remove disc 3 to get to disc 4.Disimilar to other cheap cases, however, this case uses a disc retaining system that I've never seen before and frankly hope to never see again, as it apparently doesn't work.  Despite good packaging by amazon, all four discs arrived loose in the case.  Fortunately, these aren't DVDs, which would have been scratched by the packaging for sure. Thanks to Blu-rays scratch resistant coating, the discs appeared to be undamaged.  However, the second disc froze in one spot, either due to unseen damage or replication error at the factory.  Cleaning the disc with a lint-free microfiber camera lens cleaning cloth did not help, either.  In case it is a production issue and not a result of the discs coming loose in the case or an isolated occurance, I'd suggest watching the series, at least disc two, before the return window closes, to avoid getting stuck with a defective disc - especially if your discs arrive loose too, but whether you see any damage or not.",1278892800,"07 12, 2010"
"This review was originally submitted on July 22, 2002Here is yet another video/DVD version of PETER PAN (others include the ""Disney"" version, the Mary Martin TV version, Cathy Rigby's A & E Broadcast, Speilberg's HOOK, and soon Disney's RETURN TO NEVERLAND) that should be of interest to both fans of Peter Pan and classic film buffs. It is fully restored from the archival 35mm hand-tinted elements (thought to be lost forever) of the 1924 silent film. This ""first"" film version based on the Sir James M. Barrie's extremely popular play stars Betty Bronson, who was hand-picked by the author himself. Both the video and the DVD include a fully-orchestrated score, and the DVD has some very interesting bonuses for Peter Pan enthusiasts, i.e. publicity photos and art, cast member interview, etc.. Probably closest to the original New York stage production starring Maude Adams, the film goes above and beyond with cinematic effects that were, and still are, a marvel to behold for a film produced in '20s. This is a Peter Pan of both literary and historical importance. With a new $100 million Sony Pictures/Disney joint production (P J Hogan directing) to begin soon, this classic gem should add to the ""Pan-demonium""! Incidentally the original written work by Sir James M. Barrie will be celebrating it's centennial soon, and his life will be commemorated with yet another film starring Johnny Depp as the author.",1234396800,"02 12, 2009"

"This movie is soooooo cute and makes you laugh at times.I only got this movie because I just ""love"" THE SNOWMAN! Everytime I watch The Snowman I actually cry at the end. It's just so very sad how close the boy is with his Snowman and only to have him melt away never to come back again. But... I think in my mind for a happier ending - that he rebuilds him the next year and he DOES come back to life and every year their friendship just grows and grows and they remain the best of friends forever and ever! :-) So with that said.... onto FATHER CHRISTMAS.....If you really like or love THE SNOWMAN as I do, I highly recommend this movie. However, don't look for this movie to be like The Snowman. It's a little different but with the same look (drawing and ink coloring technique). It's much funnier than THE SNOWMAN cause Santa needs a vacation and takes several through out the movie. It's a short flick but with much humor. I love when he has to keep running to the b-room!!! :D TOO CUTE and FUNNY! Also don't expect this movie to be a very serene quiet one as THE SNOWMAN because this Santa TALKS and TALKS and TALKS through out the movie but it's a NICE way of talking he does. He doesn't ramble on and on to where it's annoying. With him talking as much as he does I think with what he's saying it ADDS to the movie cause he's hilarious with some of the things he says and the way he says it as well as the way his voice sounds. I like it myself. He's a real cute Santa. The way I've always pictured Santa to be in my mind.Do get this movie as it will add humor to your holidays. It's a MUST for the avid Christmas movie/DVD collector especially if you like cartoons.Now I'm waiting to purchase Raymond Grigg's THE BEAR dvd. I've heard that's even better than this movie. But still THE SNOWMAN reigns TOP of all of them! I do agree with that. Wish there could've been THE SNOWMAN PART 2 where the boy and Snowman are reunited again for another adventure. However you do see a short clip of the two together when Santa visits I assume the North Pole in the sky where the Snowmen are having their Christmas party with lots of dancing. There you find the boy and Snowman (from THE SNOWMAN movie) too. Hope to get THE BEAR movie this year sometime in the summer long before next Christmas so that I can watch it when  Christmas comes next year! Raymond Briggs is an excellent author with such heartfelt Christmas stories. If he's still living, I wish he would continue on with his wonderful little stories for Christmas because they aren't just for kids! They are for kids at heart! :-)HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie - FATHER CHRISTMAS as well as the others ESPECIALLY ""The Snowman""!",1293148800,"12 24, 2010"

"Oddly enough, when I bought a movie named Cheerleader Massacre, I was expecting to see cheerleaders.  But the folks who made this were too cheap to shell out a few bucks for cheerleader uniforms.  I can only guess, but apparently this was so Wynorski could give a paycheck to just about everybody who's been in any film he's ever made, and they're all in here for no reason whatsoever.  We start out with some good stuff, a nice murder in the woods, then some cheerleaders (wearing regular clothes) doing a cheer.  There's the usual shower scene (except one of the girls has tattoos - yuck.  Ever hear of an airbrush?), Then there's a spooky locker room scene which was basically lifted from Slumber Party Massacre.  After that, the movie shifts into neutral.  The girls get in a van and head into the mountains, the van runs out of gas, they swear like truck drivers (maybe this was Biker Babe Massacre?) and complain and whine, then they happen to find a cabin.  The atmosphere here is nice, they do a good job of letting the audience feel the coldness of the mountains.  But, then the movie shifts into park.  We see a whole bunch of cops and other assorted old guys running around, talking on phones, driving around, talking in offices, directing traffic, talking to a guy at a cabin, etc. etc. etc.  Brinke Stevens reads a few horribly written lines, and we get a flashback from Slumber Party Massacre (The same scene they just did a remake of 10 minutes earlier).  I have to admit, it is the rare movie that can do a flashback to 20 years earlier and  have the same actress who is actually 20 years younger.  Then there's more cop drama, driving through the woods, talking on radios, talking on phones, endless ""ominous"" warnings about the killer, etc.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHEERLEADERS?!?!?  Do they think we buy movies called Cheerleader Massacre to see a stinkin' cop drama?  I bet 50% of this movie is wasted on the cops.  The word ""Massacre"" is in the title - we know there's a killer on the loose - we get it already!!!  It would have been SOOOOOOOOO much better to get rid of all the stuff with the cops and instead had the cheerleaders doing cheerleader stuff.  Whatever that might be;  I imagine it might be pretty interesting.  I guess now I'll never know.  We never get to spend much time with these girls, we don't know them at all, we don't care about them at all.I will give the movie a couple of stars for the nudity - Diana Espen aka April Flowers is awesome! - but that's about it.",1124928000,"08 25, 2005"

"I'm never quite sure if I'm reviewing the product I received or the content on the DVDs. So I'm just going to be honest. I love Hannibal, mostly for season 2. Season 1 was awkward because it was figuring itself out, but season 2 was great. Season 3 was pretty much just a mess. They didn't have enough plot for a whole Season 3, so they shortened it and included Red Dragon as the second half because they suspected they were going to be cancelled, which they were. So, to summarize, in Season 3 (in 13 episodes) they do a version of the entire book of Hannibal, albeit out of order, they resolve a lingering situation from Season 2, and then they do the entire book Red Dragon. So it's kind of a mess; it feels rushed and disjointed a lot of the time, in my opinion. There are just a lot of details that, if they authors gave it a little more time, would have made a lot more sense, especially once you hear the commentary. And maybe there are some scenes that I haven't watched yet that still don't make sense even with commentary. :) I agree they did not have enough material with where they started to draw that plot out into a whole season, but that doesn't mean you then rush through 2 books. It was just not as good, in my opinion, as their other season.And in terms of the quality of the product I received, the case has a piece in the center that turns to hold 2 discs. Mine arrived broken in one place, with one of the DVDs loose in the case. It appears that the DVD is not scratched badly enough that it cannot play, so I didn't bother with the hassle of returning it. But I just thought I'd share. :)",1461888000,"04 29, 2016"

"A nice effort as bringing to the cinema one of the most dramatic episodes of WW2 but unfortunately it is a bit hit and miss.For most people of my generation in the UK the plot to assassinate Hitler is pretty well known.  For most, it was put together by high ranking German army officers who saw the hopelessness of the German cause in WW2 and hoped with Hitler out of the way they could negotiate a more amicable truce with the allies and therein lies the problem.  The film has no real depth or background.  For a 2 hour film I felt like that Christopher Walker character in the film true romance where he said ""What we have here is a game of show and tell, you show me everything but don't tell me anything""We have the officers who are planning the assassination but no real background of what has motivated them to do so.  All we have is that they saw the annihilation of Germany and Europe and wanted the war to end.  All well and good but just how did they intend to do that?  What kind of truce did they hope to negotiate?  With whom did they intend to negotiate with?  The Soviets who has suffered the most under German invasion, the Western Allies who were by 1944 equally in little mood of any kind of amicable truce with Germany and what kind of post truce Europe were they hoping to create?  One that Germany still occupies large parts of Europe or one where they returned to pre war borders?  Did they ally themselves with any of the resistance in occupied Europe and if not why not?  Did they have contact with the allies and what kind of help were they given?  What kind of government did they wish to set up?  A democracy, a military dictatorship?  You would think in a 2 hour film we would be given some background to the coup/assassination attempt but I felt like I was back in school with that tired uninterested history teacher just telling me ""And there was an assassination attempt on Hitler which if it succeeded may have ended the war earlier""Positives are in the film the actual extent of the assassination attempt/coup the fact that this was a very real attempt to overthrow the Hitler regime but as I say, there is very little in the film to give the viewer any insight to it.  I understand that this film gave great concern in Germany where sensitivity in regards to WW2 would possibly be most felt however, my main concerns with this film are what is left out of it rather than its actual contents.  Cruise does a fairly decent job as the main character and though people have argued that an American accent spoils the film I would say its no worse than the generic English accent that usually accompanies war film I mean the film Enemy at the Gates has full English accents throughout the film even though its set in WW2 Stalingrad! To be honest I would rather have Cruise stick to his own accent than try and attempt a German accent.I give this 3 stars as its fairly fast moving and the whole coup plot is quite interesting however I would say it is seriously lacking in content.",1254528000,"10 3, 2009"

"I'm not sure when it was.. 10 minutes in, 20.. when the creeping, utterly unwanted thought came into my head the first time I watched this film - ""oh no.. it's really, really BAD.""Fair enough, few films could meet the hype and expectations that THIS one had, but it must have took some considerable skill to screw it up THIS much. As a bog-standard sci-fi adventure, it's average. Looks mighty nice, sure, but there's nothing there. The one promising character (Darth Maul) is in it for about four minutes, and the rest are bland cardboard cut-outs - all except one, which we'll get to later. As a Star Wars movie, which gave us Han Solo, Boba Fett, the Death Star, Jabba, Darth Vader, speeder bikes and countless other iconic moments which are engrained on a whole generations minds - it's borderline criminal.There is none of the flair of the first movies, no witty one-liners, no quoteable moments - and absolutely ZERO chemistry between any of the characters. For what it could have been, and for what has went before it, it really could be one of the worst films ever made.One of the main characters who helps this film garner that accolade? Step forward Jar Jar Binks. Was he supposed to be funny? Loveable? I don't know - because every time I see him I want to hurt kittens. Every time I hear him I want to shoot puppies. The most loathsome, teeth-nashingly AWFUL character in the history of movies, he nontheless takes up CHUNKS of movie time - falling over! Talking in a stupid voice! Stepping in dung! You'll laugh till you slit your wrists.I guess this is what happens when you become TOO powerful. George Lucas seriously needed someone to whisper into his ear, ""you know, George.. maybe we need a drastic re-think, here"".But alas, that wasn't to be. So we have the turgid first part, the arguably worse second part and the good third part, before we can get onto the REAL Star Wars movies.Because this?

"I really don't recall seeing the mutant on the cover. A sugar company is run by bad characters and worse actors. Together with a guy with a bad Russian accent, they kidnap street urchins and experiment on them with a substance that will make sugar more addicting (give me a break.). It seems the kidnappers error and take a couple who aren't street urchins, one of which is related to two people who work for the same sugar company. A company called ""Shadowrock"" (Blackstone?) is responsible for the security of the experiment area, which is in an abandoned warehouse. The movie is light on mutants. The warehouse is eventually set ablaze using cartoonish computer generated special effects, which wasn't much better than holding a match in front of a camera. The beginning of the film is a 5 minute narration during the credits of a guy who tells us his mission was to watch, gather intelligence and not get involved. He informs us of this in numerous different ways and sometimes repeats the old ones, just to be sure we have this relatively unimportant plot point. He does some minor intrusive narration during the film. While hoping he is the first to die, alas he lives for a possible sequel. The movie finally gets to the interesting point: Millions of tons of infected sugar have left the mill and we have forgotten the word, ""recall.""

I remember seeing something similar to this movie as a kid.  I just cannot recall the title of that movie.Anyways, Jamie Ashen returns to his childhood hometown, Raven's Fair, after his wife was mysteriously murdered.  She was murdered almost immediately after the couple has received an anonymous mail at their doorstep, which contained a dummy.Jamie soon learns that the dummy, Billy, is a product of a dead ventriloquist, Mary Shaw.  Mary Shaw was murdered some years ago after the townspeople suspected her of murdering a young boy who doubted her ventriloquist talent.  Her tongue was ripped out and she was buried with her ""children"", all 101 of her dummies.However, these days, her dummies are coming back from the grave.  The question is why?  Who is behind these mysterious murders?  Mary Shaw?

"Maybe I am too much of a realist, or am spoiled by contemporary movies, but there were things about this film that were just too illogical. To begin with, what was the point of faking Edgar Brodie's (John Gielgud) death so he could be sent out as a spy for England? Supposedly his death was faked because he was well known. After his funeral, he was given a fake name and passport and sent off on his mission. Why not just simply give him the fake name and passport without the fake death? There was no point to it. Furthermore, would British intelligence really send out someone like the character Madeleine Carroll played (Else) to do a dangerous spy mission? (She had no stomach for the dark arts of espionage, and even questioned that the German spy was a spy because he was so ""nice."") Would British Intelligence really send out the fake couple Mr. and Mrs. Ashenden (Gielgud and Carroll) without any training?

"Recently watched movie review:*Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)- 1.5/5Resident Evil: Retribution is the 5th installment in the Resident Evil film series. It's based off the Resident Evil video game series, and is written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson for the 3rd time. The movie has many returning actors and characters, and the series introduces new characters from the video game. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is captured by the Umbrella Corporation, but escapes, and continues to hunt those responsible for the T-Virus outbreak.For a movie series like Resident Evil, I try to watch every single movie again in the series before seeing the latest. I do this for many reasons including being able to fully review from the series. For Resident Evil: Retribution, I didn't watch the previous movies again before watching this film. From memory, I've never been a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise, and I recall giving Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) a 3/5 (the highest rating in the series) when I saw it back in 2010. Simply put, Resident Evil: Retribution was a waste of my time and money.For starters, the plot is very uninteresting and I didn't care what happened or who died. Secondly, the deaf child character bugged me; I've never seen a deaf person speak so well, and why are all of the characters acting like she can hear them without sign language? Thirdly, the acting is simply terrible. Fourthly, why are so many of the action scenes in slow-mo? In most movies I love when the action is slowed down, but when I don't care about the movie, it just makes it drag on even longer. Fifthly, I thought the film needed to explain itself a lot more. There are so many unanswered questions, it boggles my mind. Sixthly, there's so much action and not enough story. Lastly, this series has run its course, and unfortunately there's probably going to be another one on the way.Now, there are some things I did like about Resident Evil: Retribution. The new gadgets are cool and the action scenes kick-ass. I really liked the opening credits, and while I saw the movie in 2D, I will recommend that you see it in 3D as there's plenty of cool 3D moments. Well, that about sums up the good parts about the movie. I'm not happy that I didn't watch the previous films again before watching Retribution, and when I watch the series over again, my rating and review might change, but I feel confident enough to write a review now. Overall, if you're a fan of this series, you'll probably like this new edition, but can you really take that much more? To the rest of you viewers, I have to give Resident Evil: Retribution a recommended 'must-pass.'",1353628800,"11 23, 2012"
"Set was bought with other dvds and properly packed for shipping. When I eventually got to watch this set, the three dvd cases were plastic wrapped together with an outer label. After removing the wrapping I found the first case cracked on the bottom at the back of the case, almost to the spine, and the disc was loose. The disc was very scratched up and the first episode would not play at all past 4 minutes and the second episode stalled for a time before resuming. Since this case was on top in the pack, the damage had to be made prior to wrapping the three cases together since damage would be unlikely to occur in that area with the cases bundled together as they were.Only two stars for poor judgement in sending a damaged product. I enjoyed the episodes I did get to see, but there are only 4 episodes per disc and not being able to see 25% of the first disc made this a bad purchase.",1449446400,"12 7, 2015"

"There have been many fine movies over the years about alcoholism and drug addiction but relatively few about an equally pernicious addiction... compulsive gambling. Forty years ago, James Toback wrote the screenplay for ""The Gambler,"" a semi-autobiographical script (originally planned as a novel) about his own problem gambling, and James Caan, who was battling his own cocaine addiction at the time, starred. The life experiences of both men showed through clearly in the movie. Simply put, ""The Gambler"" is the best, and most realistic depiction of compulsive gambling I've ever seen in a movie.Caan plays Axel Freed, like Toback, an English teacher at a New York community college. He's smart, easy going, funny, and a nice guy to be around. Everybody likes him: his students, his relatives, his girlfriend (Lauren Hutton), his bookie (Paul Sorvino), and even the loan sharks to whom he goes. His only problem is that he can't stop gambling, on anything. At one point, he even bets $20 against a dime in a game of one-on-one basketball against a street kid. And he has managed to get himself $44,000 in debt to Sorvino and the people Sorvino reports to. It's only because he is a genuinely likable guy that they haven't pushed him harder for the money, but his time is clearly running out.The movie follows Caan around for several days as he tries to raise the money. His mother, a well-to-do doctor, gives him what money she can because she's genuinely afraid what will happen to him, but he uses the money to take Hutton with him to Las Vegas to gamble further. Incredibly, he goes on a hot streak and wins enough to square all his debts and have a good bit left over. However, he blows everything betting on basketball games and has to figure out some other way to raise the money.Many people who watch the movie have a hard time believing just how or why Caan can keep going like this, but the movie eventually makes his compulsion quite clear. Like a junkie addicted to heroin, he's addicted to the thrill of winning. He knows the odds are against him, but he convinces himself that he can beat the odds. When he does, it's a big thrill, so he bets again in search of an even bigger thrill. The more pressure he feels in his everyday life... such as arguments with his girl friend or relatives, the more he feels he needs the thrill. Eventually, of course, his luck--and the thrills--inevitably run out. This rationale makes no sense to most people; addiction never does. But, as Toback explains it and Caan demonstrates it, viewers can see how even an intelligent person can get hooked.""The Gambler"" was directed by Karel Reisz, who had a terrific sense of visual style, and he contrasts the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas when Caan is winning, with the gloom of the New York scenes where he eventually loses all over again. The movie's signature visual, a shot of Caan at the tables, surrounded by neon lights creating an angelic halo effect, stayed with me since I first saw the movie in a theater forty years ago. Jerry Fielding contributes a classical based score that creates a mood of grand tragedy which, essentially, the movie is.I own a DVD of ""The Gambler"" but hadn't watched it for several years until I went to see the Mark Wahlberg remake last week and decided to watch the original again. Seeing the two movies almost back-to-back has given me a renewed appreciation for the original. Although the storylines of both versions are somewhat similar, the original has power, emotional depth, and credibility that the slick remake completely lacks. The only good thing I can say about the remake is that it might prompt some people to discover the original. ""The Gambler"" is a nearly forgotten minor gem from one of the best eras of American film making, the early 1970s. Watching it is no gamble; it's a sure thing.NOTE: The specs on the Amazon page say that the movie has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. That is incorrect. As indicated on the DVD cover, the movie is anamorphic widescreen with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.",1420070400,"01 1, 2015"
"I first saw this movie when it came out several years ago because I was a huge Jude Law fan. I  watched it again last night,and it is even better, more nuanced and complex than I remembered. It's a beautiful, classy suspense film and psychological thriller. Matt Damon is  Ripley, a true villain,  who hides his sick, cunning dark side behind a facade of obsequiousness, awkwardness, naivet and  people pleasing. Damon is so good, playing a character consumed by jealousy and repressed lust, driven to murder and soul suicide. Jude Law created a seductive, complex human being in Dickie Greenleaf, heir to a fortune, spoiled, irresistible. Law is exceptionally talented and had a great knack for playing beautiful, seductive young men and I love watching him. I admire him, too, for not pursuing super stardom based on his looks. He' s really an actor's actor and I love him for that, too!  I had forgotten that PhilipSeymour Hoffman was in this movie, and appreciate even more now his huge talent. His ability to disappear into a role and his inventiveness was magical. Gwyneth Paltrow, CateBlanchett, Jack Davenport and James Rebhorn --all give award worthy performances.Set in Italy, the photography and design, from sets to lighting to clothing, create a delicious, captivating, scary entertainment. Tthe violence is shocking, especially because you care about the victims.This is a classic and I highly recommend it, even if you've seen it before.

"This a favorite book of mine--I've read it twice--and I eagerly awaited the film version.  What a disappointment.Biggest problem for me was poor casting, starting with the lead role.  Gillian Anderson proves here why she's only been successful on a sci-fi television show.  Dan Ackroyd and Anthony LaPaglia are both good actors, but both seemed out of place here.  Only Laura Linney shined; the film would have been far better if she had played Lillie Bart.  (And speaking of out of place, using old, ivy covered Scottish houses for old New York brownstones looked ridiculous.)Save your money and read, or re-read, Wharton's novel.",1322179200,"11 25, 2011"

"Although I recognize the need to omit characters in certain movies, I would've preferred to see Sheridan, Londo and G'Kar as the stars of the movies since they are my favorite characters.  Perhaps in the sense of the TNG movies which focused on Picard for every film.OK, the soundtrack to Crusade was nothing less than horrible.  Let's leave it at that.  Really detracted away from the movie experience which was all ready not that spectacular.Characters are twisted and turned in Arms, etc.  I found the technomages in the entire series a bit cheesey.  They were supposed to use technology to mimic magic, but how does the technomage able to give Sheridan revelations? The thief character was nothing special.  A thief with an attitude and a loner type.  Not very original.  It seems like they purposely make Sheridan into a second rate character so they can 'boost' his replacements which was a bit lame.",1097884800,"10 16, 2004"

"FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC was a bad movie.  Why in the world did the producers of this movie try to take a very adult and twisted novel and make it into a teenage film?

The kids overacted, the dialog was painful and the direction was very pedstrian and hard to watch at times.  Although the running time was barely ninety minutes, the bad directing made it feel like it was so much longer.What happens when you try to compress a three hundred plus page novel and cram it into a ninety minute picture?

"I was on my true UFO stories night.  It happened accidentally with Dark Skies on Showtime on when I turned on the TV.  Then I found and watched The Fourth Kind.  Both disturbing.  Then I thought this would be down the same lane.  I was mistaken. This is not worth anyone's time for any reason.  It is done in the epic failure nonsense as Blair Witch Project.You might sit in front of this nightmare... and I mean that in the sense of wasting time, and be mesmerized but really?The Dyatlov pass deaths in 1959 may have been something to be further examined but with the alien suggestion I thought I might be watching something with the same credibility as The Fourth Kind... witch BTW is rather disturbing because of the documentation. (I pray that isn't also a deception).In conclusion, if you have an inkling's respect for your time, don't waste it on this nonsense.  If you really want to explore unexplainable things, this one is pure fiction, which is sad because it taints any serious examination of the real events of 1959.",1400284800,"05 17, 2014"

"Before seeing this movie via my cable provider, I must say I was looking forward to the reunion of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (since their other film ""Wedding Crashers""). ""The Internship"" deals with adults seeking employment, which is identical to almost all people living in real life. This movie portrays real situations where adults get laid-off or terminated from their jobs and then must find employment but end up competing in an (unpaid) internship to secure a job (in this movie, with the most popular company on this planet, Google). Yes, there were a lot of funny scenes, but most of this movie fell flat. However, hearing Alanis Morisette's song ""Ironic"" at the begining of this film brought back memories from the 90's... Anyway, the obviously memorable scenes were inside Google's buildings in Northern California (whether or not it's identical to the real Google's headquarters, I don't know). ""The Internship"" could have been better and was not as big a hit as ""Wedding Crashers"". However, the important (yes, I said important) scene in ""The Internship"" was of the online video interview between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and the two interviewers working with Google. The one ridiculous but interesting question ""If you were shrunk to the size of a nickel and in a blender, what would you do?"" (or something to that effect) is a question that seems would be asked in reality by Google and the question's preposterous question makes you ""think outside the box"" (or in this case, outside the blender), but is no surprise since most hiring managers want to ""weed out"" interviewees or job applicants. Is it fair and reasonable? Like cold, rational-minded people who have no sympathy and empathy say, ""that's life"". Bottom line: Is ""The Internship"" worth watching? Yes, because it mirrors applying for jobs in reality. No, because it was not as entertaining as ""Wedding Crashers"".",1435104000,"06 24, 2015"
I am rewatching this movie again. I really enjoy the scenery n like when they take the boat ride n talk about the water wheel. It is the only time I feel his trip helped the Chinese people.  The scene of negotiation with the warlord showed some of chinese culture known only to the Chinese.  The idea of the trip seemed suicidal.  I would have died of boredom in the shack with absolutely nothing to do or like. The neighbor guy at least knew their was an outlet from total dreariness.

WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS HAZZARDOUS MATERIAL!Now you see me apparently did quite well at the box-office due to its draw-card casting. (a very Hollywood manoeuvre.) unfortunately for people with a brain the size of an atom the whole premise is as ridiculous as a Hollywood movie. it's about four (horsemen) magicians who think they're modern robin hoods. Michael cain and morgan freeman obviously needed some cash otherwise they wouldn't be in this (or would they...).the premise is silly and from there the foundational silliness is built upon. the car crash near the end was the cherry on the botulism-cake for me. so implausible and thus so stupid.so much computer generated graphics is doused throughout this film it seems natural. the 'acting' in it is as camp as a row of soldiers waiting for weekend at Bernie's. research revealed one was in an Australian soap opera (!)if you can borrow this from a library or such you're free to - but DO NOT waste money on this WASTE of time and MONEY.,1524700800,"04 26, 2018"
"Please don't waste your money on this one. Just buy either The Jesus Movie or even better the 3 hour version. You will regret buying this one.

I was so disappointed that I paid for this very short video. Maybe it's 30 minutes, but it seemed like 20. The box says the running time includes the bonus material, so the actually movie is like half that. These are really great videos. My toddler seems to understand and repeat everything that is going on, so my review is not reflexing the quality or content of the production, simply how short it is for the money and how it is the exact same content as the other longer videos.

"'Semi-Pro is the latest Will Farrell film, in which he plays Jackie Moon, the owner, coach and power forward of the fictional Flint Tropics basketball team in the American Basketball Association (ABA). He was also a disco singer who had one hit, called 'Love Me Sexy' and he insists on playing the song to death throughout the movie. Anyways, the Flint Tropics happen to be the worst team in the ABA (sound familiar yet?), mostly due to Jackie's lack of direction. It is soon revealed that the ABA will cease to exist and only 4 teams will be merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA). When Jackie finds out that his team will not be integrated into the NBA, he attempts to whip his team into shape. With the help of former Kentucky Colonels player Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson), Jackie plans to push the Tropics to victory, and into the NBA.What follows is your typical heartfelt, underdog sports story (with the Will Farrell brand of comedy of course). If you've ever seen 'Blades of Glory' or 'Dodgeball' or any of the other numerous underdog sports films then you know exactly how this film will turn out. The ending doesn't turn out exactly as the aforementioned films do, but there are enough similarities in this movie that its hard not to draw comparisons. The jokes run the usual gamot, with potty, genital and sexual jokes being at the forefront. To be quite honest most of the jokes feel way too outdated to be funny; I seem to remember similar punch lines in Farrell's previous outings. Farrel gives the impression that he is merely giving us a phoned in performance, but being that he's been making the same movies since Anchorman I don't blame him. The supporting actors are decent, though nothing really stands out aside from Andre 3000, who seems to be getter better at acting. Even Harrelson seems like he's nonplussed to be appearing in this mediocre film, and his performance reeks of lazy. Will Arnett (Arrested Development) plays an alcoholic sports play by play announcer, however he feels rather underused here. Every single joke he throws out is un-funny.I watched this movie not expecting to enjoy it, and honestly there wasn't really a funny joke to be found. Will Farrell, one of the more successful of the SNL alumni has found his niche and he is running with it no matter how atrocious and stale the end result may be. He just keeps pumping out the same jokes and the same routine over and over, and we keep eating it up. If you are a Farrell fan then purchasing this film is probably a no-brainer, but if you are sick of his usual shtick like I am you may just want to rent this one.As far as this Blu Ray edition is concerned, the theatrical cut and the 'Lets get sweaty' unrated cut are featured on one disc, while a second disc houses a load of special features. The differences between the two versions of the film are negligible.  The special features are your usual  comedy special feature fare, nothing too great.The picture quality is decent; 'Semi-Pro' isn't going to turn any heads but its a step above the Standard DVD. Colors are rather vivid and blacks  are deep and realistic. Detail is present but very inconsistent, and there is a fair bit of grain spiking in some scenes. Since this is a comedy with rather bland 70's colors I didn't except demo material, but 'Semi-pro' looks pretty good. As far as the audio is concerned, 'Semi-Pro' comes with a 7.1 mix, though the subject material never fully utilizes it.I'm sure this isn't the last of the 'underdog' films, and certainly not the last Ferrell underdog film. I really wish it was, because these movies are getting really tiresome.Movie Quality - 2/5Picture Quality - 4/5Audio Quality - 3/5Special Features - 1/5",1213920000,"06 20, 2008"

"I enjoy twisted fairy tales; however, I am not a fan of stoner movies.  I was hoping the witch would eat everyone but alas it didn't happen.  I didn't really find the stoner jokes funny...yes I know when one gets stoned the munchies usually follow;;ha ha...but the jokes aren't new or funny and have been done way too many times in other movies.  Actually, I didn't care much for any of the characters except for the witch.  I found her amusing as she ate her way to a more younger looking woman.  I didn't understand why the witch had zombies...??  In the fairy tale the witch didn't have zombies but I suppose times are changing and a witch has to do what a witch has to do (the witch said something similar when zombies were mentioned in the flick)...anyhoo...the zombies didn't seem to belong in the movie,  I suppose they were thrown in so one could have his head chopped in two.  Cerebus also enters the picture except he isn't a 3 headed dog he is a pincher....I don't recall the witch having a dobie but..anyhoo...the film starts out a stoner comedy then turns into a stupid comedy with traces of fairy tale when Gretel's stoner boyfriend, Ashton, goes missing.

"I laughed while watching ""Life as We Know It"", the newest Kathryn Heigl vehicle. Heigl has a unique sort of movie star look and evokes memories of some of the stars of the 50s and 60s. In fact, ""Life"" seems like a movie Doris Day might have made. I am not a huge fan of Doris Day's films.But after watching this film, I became depressed. ""Life"" is a forthy, frivolous little confection but it is also a film you will instantly forget. I find it a little sad when people make one film after another, films that do nothing to challenge their skills or showcase their talents.Holly (Kathryn Heigl) owns a small bakery in Atlanta. Her friends fix her up on a blind date with Messer (Josh Duhamel), an editor of live sports telecasts. They are completely wrong for each other and don't get along at all. In fact, they instantly hate each other. Their friends, Allison and Peter (Christina Hendricks, TV's ""Mad Men"" and Hayes MacArthur) have a baby, Sophie, and name Holly and Messer as the baby's god-parents. This forces Holly and Messer to spend time with one another at Sophie's birthday parties (Holly is a baker and brings elaborate cakes) and other family events One night, Holly gets a phone call and learns her two friends were killed in a car accident. She and Messer soon learn they are the designated guardians and reluctantly try to raise Sophie, based on their friend's last wishes.In reading this synopsis, you can probably guess just about every ""twist and turn"", if such obvious moments can be labeled as such. This is always a problem in my eyes. Yes, the familiar is welcome in some circumstances, but while watching a film or television show, familiarity usually leads to boredom.There are some funny moments and some funny observations, but they seem too forced, too sitcomy and too few and far between. The film is directed by Greg Berlanti, who comes from television. He is currently one of the producers of the new television series ""No Ordinary Family"", which is better than this film. When someone comes from a television background, you hope they will use the opportunity to make a film to push for something different and better, something more challenging. But ""Life"" plays like a sitcom or dramedy. When Messer is faced with a problem, he is saddled with Sophie when he has an opportunity to direct his first sports broadcast, his solution plays out like something you would see on CBS on Monday night. It is not necessarily something you want to pay $11 or more to experience in a theater.I have seen a number of Kathryn Heigl's films and I have always laughed at her performances. Given the fact she and her mother serve as Executive Producer on her films, she is clearly trying to model her career after the comedy stars of yesteryear. She seems to want to be the next Katharine Hepburn or the next Rosalind Russell. Is she as good as either of these classic actresses? No way, but she holds some promise.What I find disappointing is that her films are so mediocre. This seems to be the result of everyone associated with the films; the studio okaying the film, the writer(s) who provide the predictable 'madcap"" story, the director who can't make the film something new and interesting. But most importantly, the fault lies with Heigl herself. If, as Executive Producer, she doesn't push the people working on the project to produce something interesting, who will? I still think she holds promise, I am still waiting for a truly memorable film role, but I won't be waiting for much longer.Josh Duhamel is also extremely likable but he also hasn't delivered on the promise many believe he has shown. A former soap actor (""All My Children""), he then starred on ""Las Vegas"" leading to a role in a surprisingly good romantic comedy called ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"". The ""Transformers"" films follow, one good and one bad. Maybe the third will be the charm. But it is difficult for him to stand out amid all of the cacophony and destruction of these mega-budget films. His last few films have been disappointing. In ""Life"", Messer is a mess and he doesn't realize it. But you know that over the course of the film, he will learn what is important in life and he will become a better person. This doesn't come as a surprise does it?Josh Lucas, also once a promising actor who is extremely charismatic, plays the guy Holly is interested in and attracted to. He is completely the opposite of Messer, a successful pediatrician who does everything possible to woo the caf&eacute; owner, he doesn't stand a chance. What happened to his career? Wow! He is now relegated to playing the guy Kathryn Heigl doesn't want or end up with?And when you see one film after another in which people just don't move forward, that is truly depressing.

"I watched this film in a European Cinema class and thinking about it months later I'm still in awe. The first of the dogma 95 films, many people may critique the movement itself for its many times, amateurish, filmmaking strategies but what this movement touched on and what The Celebration illustrates beautifully is the power of acting and writing. This film makes me want to be a better screenwriter. With such a powerful story the antics that are so easily relied on in Hollywood today are completely unnecessary as you are too enthralled in the family drama, to care about special effects and CGI. That aside the filmmaking itself is breathtaking even more so when one considered the 10 commandments all dogma 95 films must adhere to. This is a seriously powerful film and one I would recommend to anyone who loves cinema and wants something fresh and impactful.",1310083200,"07 8, 2011"

"THE LONG GOOD-BYE comes from a championship bloodline.  Like the Kennedy teeth and jaw line, it has scenes in which you recognize its heritage, that being Altman.  For that it gets some points, but that alone can't keep it afloat.  The concept of mixing up Raymond Chandler's classic hardboiled detective character Philip Marlowe with 70's Los Angeles must have looked good on paper but in execution it is hazy.  Part of the problem is that Elliott Gould's Marlowe is half 70's mentality and a whiff retro, thus killing the irony of contrast with the times.  Women do not fare well in this film:  they are topless hippies, brutalized mistresses or, possibly, bad guys.  Drippy. When it comes down to it, the only moral touchstones in this flick--and every story needs at least one--are the cat and the dog, and they aren't in enough scenes.  If you want a thriller and a more evocative retro/present look at LA, as well as a name brand of sorts, get Kenneth Brannagh's DEAD AGAIN.  If what you want is more Altman, then knock yourself out with this.",995241600,"07 16, 2001"
"Don't know what all the hype is, a good book but the movie shoves too much in, or shall we say tries to, moving from one plot line (or bachelor) to the next quickly and without foundation. We see the heroine going from an independent and willful woman determined to make it on her own, to foolishly falling for a weak man who doesn't even love her in too short a time without proper buildup. It just isn't realistic, maybe those who read the book will enjoy this more but I found it difficult to watch and not very well done.

"A thousand people will love this film, but i'm one of the few people who hated it. I first saw the preview and it didn't look so good back then. I love movies so I went to go see it anyway and boy did it suck. The Decepticons looked awesome but the movie followed every basic summer blockbuster cliche known to man. Here are some problems I hate with the filmThe red and green car followed Sam around and the little truck robot were all stereotypes. Red and green acted like gangsta's and reminded me of Jar Jar Binks in a way. They were so friggin annoying. The truck played off as a wise guy from Brooklyn. He reminded me of Frank from Men in Black but less cuter to look at.Sex. A movie staring Megan Fox had sex in it and it wasn't five stars?! Well if you consider two dogs humping and that little truck robot humping Megan Fox's leg as hot, then I guess you got issues.John Turturro's character in this movie was a direct rip off of Randy Quaid's character in Independence Day.Megan Fox was a sexy, there is no arguing that. She looked alot like Angelina Jolie in this film but way would you film more then half here scenes in slow-motion? But damn, she is friggin smoking.The humor was the kind of quick chuckle but doesnt last long kind. Make sense? I didn't laugh at anything in here but im sure plenty of people laughed at Sam's mom high on brownies. There was anther annoying character, sorry to digress but this film had some really annoying characters in it.The story lacked suspense as you could tell what was going happen before it happened.I cant really say I enjoyed to much of the film. The bad guys looked cool, some fights were pretty neat, and Megan Fox is smoking hot.All in all, it's a summer film. It's an escape from work or too get the kids off your back for a few hours. It's entertainment and not the meaning of life. I may have crapped on this film but I know thousands of people will go away saying it was the greatest film this summer or of all time.",1245974400,"06 26, 2009"

"The original Sabrina was a classic, with three of the greatest stars of all time -- Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden -- being directed by Billy Wilder, one of the greatest directors of all time. To be sure, the producers of this remake did their best to duplicate the magic of the first film. It's directed by the great Sydney Pollack and stars Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly. In one way, the film is better for the casting of Harrison Ford in place of Humphrey Bogart. Ford probably wasn't much younger than Bogart was when he made his version. But Bogart seemed older than the 54 he was when the original was made. Ford, in contrast, seems much more youthful ( even with Linus Larabee's stuffy persona) and more of a natural match for Sabrina.However, all of these quality elements are negated by the casting of Julia Ormond as Sabrina Fairchild. To be sure, Ormond is a beautiful woman. However, she has the charisma of a pile of wet toilet paper. She has absolutely none of the allure of her predecessor in the role and comes off very, very badly because of it. I know it's unfair to compare most actresses with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn, but this, after all, is the role she created, so she is being held to a higher standard. I knew there was a problem with the movie when I found myself more attracted to Lauren Holly as Greg Kinnear's jilted fiancee than Julia Ormond as the lead. Because of this bad casting, the film just falls flat and pales in comparison to the original. Too bad.",1086220800,"06 3, 2004"

"<strong>Beyond the Door III</strong> (Jeff Kwitny, 1989)<em>Beyond the Door III</em>, also released under its original title <em>Amok Train</em>, has as much to do with the first two <em>Beyond the Door</em> movies as <em>Zombie 5: Killing Birds</em> has to do with <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>... in other words, not a damn thing. What it <em>is</em>, and what gives it the rather limited appeal it has, is an attempt by two Americans, LA director Jeff Kwitny (<em>Lightning in a Bottle</em>) and Sheila Goldberg (who, perhaps not coincidentally, co-wrote the script for <em>Killing Birds</em> with director Claudio Lattanzi), to make a supernatural <em>giallo</em>. The end result doesn't work too well, but you've got to admire the gumption, no?Plot: a college professor and some of her charges head off into the wilds of Eastern Europe for their comparative religion class (note: I'm extrapolating there, it could just as easily be an archeology class. Or sociology. Or calculus, in a particularly weird school.), where they hook up with ultra-creepy Professor Andromolek (<em>Walking Tall</em>'s Bo Svenson). Andromolek takes them even father from civilization, to a small village in the middle of nowhere where everyone bunks down for the night in preparation for some sort of ancient religious ritual the next day. Problem is, it's kind of like getting invited to dinner by cannibals; you never know if you're a guest or the main course. One of the students, Beverly <em>Mr. Baseball</em>'s Mary Kohnert), is a virgin, and the village folks are planning on sacrificing her to conjure up the devil. Where does the train come into all this, you ask? Some of the escaping students stumble upon a track and hop the train, which is full of all sorts of weirdos who make the villagers look positively friendly in comparison...While this is certainly not deathless cinema, it's hard to deny its influence on things that have popped up since; the 2008 torture-porn flick <em>Train</em> seems to be almost a direct descendant of the second half of this movie, for example. And while it's full of the usual silliness one expects from bad low-budget cinema (awful acting, murky camerawork, fumbling direction, script full of plot holes, etc.), it's hard to deny the film is entertaining on some levels. Stupid, yes, but entertaining. If you're a fan of the Satanic-panic films of the eighties, this is going to be right up your alley, and were I you I would definitely check it out. The rest of you, maybe not so much unless you're familiar enough with movies like it to know what you're getting into. **",1329264000,"02 15, 2012"

"""Hey Max..., A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anyone will notice?""  - Vincent's time runs out in ""Collateral""From Michael Mann, the director of ""Heat"" and the creator of ""Miami Vice"" (when the hell is that series coming to DVD?!), comes ""Collateral"", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!).Tom Cruise is Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who has just arrived in L.A., with 10 hrs. to kill.Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. cabdriver who works the night shift for the past 12 years in hopes of one day fulfilling his dream of owning his own island cab company.After Max hooks up with an attractive D.A. (potrayed Jada Pinkett Smith) & getting her phone number, he meets his next customer, Vincent, and Max's hellish nightmare begins.Vincent offers six hundred bucks to Max, in return for taking him around the Los Angeles area to meet some friends that Vincent has to see. Max soon finds out, the hard way, that Vincent is a hired assasin, & not only in town with time to kill, but, the friends he mentioned are federal witnesses, to a high profile case, that Vincent must, one-by-one like the Grim Reaper, assasinate. The plot thickens when Max finds out the D.A., he met earlier in the evening, is on Vincent's list.With the police and the F.B.I. hot on the trail, & the clock ticking down to the early morning dawn, Max is forced to find a way to stop Vincent, save the girl, and not become public enemy number one in the eyes of the cops & the feds. Time is not on Max's side.What makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.Cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers ""Collateral"", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination. Cruise's Vincent is one mean mother f**k in this film and comes across cool, calculative, cynical, and cocky. All the elements found in a great villian. The problem for me was, that he isn't one of those villians you love to hate. I actually liked Vincent!Foxx gives his best performance to date as Max. Foxx's Max is the typical everyman who passes the hero test by facing a great fear and rising above it all.The third character in the film is Los Angeles itself. Michael Mann directing the film using digital filmaking technology gives the city an errie sheen that regular film can't quite capture (in one scene while Vincent is walking to one of his destination's in the background the city nightline generates an errie twinkling, while in another Max driving on the freeway toward the nightclub, one can't help but watch the nightsky as the streetlights zoom by). Mann does a great job at generating, and keeping the flow of the action going thruout ""Collateral"" (I didn't find that the film had any real drag to it).""Collateral"", like Los Angeles, is cold, hard, & full of action. Definitely not to be missed.",1092528000,"08 15, 2004"

"Hope you can take my opinion on the film without flipping out on me. The movie started off so great, but I didn't like the way it ended. I mean it was realistic the way it was set up (most of it).You see the way the movie interprets how relationships, men and some women are like in real life is accurate. Most men watch porn and most women watch romance movies where the guy and girl fall in love at first sight, date, make love, fight, get mad at each other, break up, get sad, cry, and in the end have a revelation where they see the error of each others' ways, get back together again, and possibly be together for the rest of their life. However, that doesn't happen in the film (besides the film within the film). That's a good thing because I can see people want relationships like that, but never like that in real life. I like the concept and realism in it. But....... I was hoping Joseph Gordon Levitt's and Scarlett Johanson's characters would end up apologizing to each other, saying they were wrong to one and another, kiss, make up, and get back together again. But then again, that wouldn't be realistic and would be ironic. Instead, after the two break up in the MIDDLE of the film, he starts making a connection with this lady (Julianne Moore) at the night class he goes to, make a connection, and making love. That pretty much happened throughout the rest of the film and ended right there. After Johanson left, I cringed through the rest of the movie. Didn't like how he ended up with Ester. I'm sure Julianne Moore is a good actress, but pairing her with Levitt's character later in the film doesn't feel right. To me, she just feels like a side-character. Not too relevant. Can't believe I wasted an hour and a half watching this movie. It's ridiculous. Overall, Don Jon gets a 3/10. Save your money people. There are other good movies out there. Don Jon is just not one of them. Also, you can watch sexy Scarlett Johanson in her other films. You'll find her more appealing and more talented in other motion pictures besides this one. This movie was crap and this movie review is over. I'm out of here.....",1405900800,"07 21, 2014"
"Great, great film.  The look is at once both dark and brilliant. The casting and acting are superb (nice to see Rutger Hauer finally get a decent role - his best since Bladerunner).This is probably the best comic-book to film adaptation of all time.  The writer and director give us a serious rather than silly, campy take on Batman.  After Joel Schumaker (or whatever his name is/was) destroyed the franchise with his glitzy Broadway-inspired-coreographic crap I figured I would never see another Batman film in my lifetime.  I believed the Warner Bros Batman franchise was dead.  I am happy to report I was wrong.  This film makes up for those debacles and far outshines the Tim Burton films.  The franchise is alive and well. Let's hope they can keep it up.One tiny criticism - you have to buy the special edition version to get any special features. There are no special features on this edition.  Cheap stinginess on the part of Warner Bros.",1136678400,"01 8, 2006"

"Shot in a 'Blair Witch' way, this movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while. Not because of how it was shot, but due to the content.....2/3 of this movie felt like I was watching someone's boring home videos. A lot of it was just obvious filler....minute after minute of absolutley unnecessary nothing that simply killed time and didn't move the story along or was drawn out too long. There's literally 10 minutes straight of just someone running around in the dark, all you see is the camera's view with the light hitting the trees randomly and you hear someone panting. It's a looong stretch of film that's just this and this alone. This movie has a cool twist at the end, but not cool enough to make it worth the watch. This is one of those movies you start watching, realize it's boring, hang in there hoping it gets better, but it doesn't, and you struggle with yourself. Should I see it through or turn it off? Don't even bother wasting your time to get to that point! I want my 1.25 hours back! Not scary, boring, full of useless stuff to kill time to turn this into a 'movie'.

A difficult yet very rewarding and rich film experience. Isabelle Huppert (as always) is amazing in her approach to Erica in the film. Michael Haneke maintains such a tight hold on our attention and emotions throughout the whole film. This is a multi-layered gem that requires a lot of thought and several viewings. A must for film fans of Huppert and Haneke.,1510963200,"11 18, 2017"

I wonder, did Sam Raami direct this movie because his daughter was sick; does that make this abomination of a movie alright?  Sub par acting, sub par dialogue, sub par directing, sub par movie.

"Are you kidding me? People actually liked this film?! Where do I start? It wasn't scary, it wasn't a believable story, in fact you can find credible sources on the Internet (go to Wikipedia if you don't want to waste your time searching) that will tell you that the makers of this movie were sued for planting fictitious news stories. Plus, Chapman University (mega-diploma mill) is the ""University"" investigating and doing the interviewing of the psychologist, that should tell you something right there.But I wouldn't have even had a problem with it all being faked/staged like Blair Witch Project, for example, if it was actually good. Not only was this not scary or suspenseful (or believable, did I already mention that?!) but I kept falling asleep trying to watch it - that's how scary and suspenseful it was. Terrible all-the-way around from bad acting, to the annoying way the movie was shot with the split-screens to make it seem real, etc. Worst movie I've seen in quite awhile, and I'm someone that loves alien movies, conspiracy theories, etc. In fact the X-Files was one of my all-time favorite TV shows, but this was just garbage.FINAL GRADE: D",1292803200,"12 20, 2010"

"I gave this move 4 stars because had I been able to rate aspects of the movie separately the average would have been 4.  I am a fan of M Streep and I would have given her 10 stars.  I see all of her movies because I think she has an amazing capacity to act and I love to watch her take on the various personas.  Some who we celebrate as 'great' simply play themselves or a variation of themselves in a changing array of settings.  In the past three years we have seen her go from nun to Prada-diva to Greek Island middle-aged hottie, to ageless chef to the iron lady and I may have forgotten a couple.In this less than complicated plot we see Meryl capturing the look and emotion of an empty-nested housewife whose husband has retreated into a deep cave lined with golf tip movies, newspapers and mechanical movements.  We learn later that both are responsible for the frigid status of their marriage, but here we see Meryl accurately portray the middle-aged woman who though embarrassed and vulnerable, haltingly and bravely takes steps to mitigate the situation.  Through the nuances of the relationship, Meryl, with believable depictions allows us to know how someone in this situation would feel.Steve Carell was remarkably believable as a therapist and Tommy Lee Jones played the angry curmudgeon he seems to know so well.  The plot was simple but realistic and the scenic shots were kind to the eye.And, there were no explosions, no pictures of bloody carnage, no chase scenes, no leaps from airplanes with or without benefit of parachute. Not a single shot was fired!  Absent ""action"" our attention as viewers was held rather through human interaction.  How novel!",1356825600,"12 30, 2012"

"A review of ANY movie can be subjective -- one might not like westerns, or a certain actor, or whatever.Documentaries -- ESPECIALLY documentaries about art, or books! -- are hard to do badly. Ted Newsom, the ""writer"" and ""director"" (I use those terms VERY loosely with this individual) has managed to make the WORST documentary I have ever had the misfortune of being suckered into purchasing. I googled it when buying films related to Ray Bradbury and his works. And though it supposedly covered ALL of science fiction, I figured that was okay, since I enjoy other writers, etc.  Imagine my horror -- not terror, as he would say but HORROR -- at watching Christopher Lee stumble while reading some of the most inane, ill-informed and sophomoric writing about ANY subject, as this ""documentary"" (once again, I use the term VERY loosely) droned on.  I was prepared to overlook the fact that the subject broached ISN'T, in fact, Science Fiction -- which would include discussions and interviews about novels and short stories -- because it quickly became evident that the ""documentary"" was bout science fiction (and fantasy, and horror) FILMS.  But as I continued to watch (the horror! the horror!), I found that the inane ""script"" (I use the term loosely) Christopher Lee stumbles through was accompanied by 1) LOTS of really badly edited, badly filmed (seemingly by putting in a movie on someone's TV and filming it) footage of old movies, TV shows and the like 2) one, maybe two, quick interviews -- also derived from other sources -- with one or two SF authors -- although two minutes, or so, of Ray Bradbury is all I remember 3) a few interviews with actors and movie types (Denzel Washington, etc.) who KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING about science fiction (one of the interviews, with Kevin Cosner, consisted of his defending the cost of producing ""Waterworld"").In summation: WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE on Amazon (and that includes a badly done documentary of Charles Beaumont)!AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS!",1342310400,"07 15, 2012"

People you love, and people you love to hate.  Two strong players that stand out are Kathy and Boston Rob. It's easy to see why they were brought back to for All-Stars.

"The film opens up with all the excitement of watching your neighbor's vacation films...which is what we are doing. Two couples are touring Eurasia.

Paul hooks up with the proverbial Russian named Uri (Dimitri Diatchenko) who offers him a backdoor tour of the abandoned city of Chernobyl (Pripyat). Another couple joins them because seven people make for a better horror film than five...except in this case.While I was waiting for a scene out of ""Hostel"" or something interesting to happen, it didn't happen. Instead the van breaks down (it would be a quick movie if it didn't) and our group of tourists are stuck in a restricted area with no communication. The movie has that jittery hand held camera action to it, which I have grown to hate. To make the thrills cheaper, they turn out the lights and have everyone scream in terror. Oh, Chris has a boo-boo on his leg.Eventually the film budget allows them to use lighting and then they run the credits.F-bombs, no sex, no nudity.***Possible Plot Spoiler**** This film is similar to ""Quarantine"" in that you have to wait until the very end to get a glimpse of what is causing the terror.

On top of all of that, with the exception of Jaime Hammer these aren't A-listers, so they aren't really enough to keep your attention.The final vignette is indeed pretty hot (lesbian scene) and much more explicit than what you'd expect from Peach, but that's just too little, too late.",1359936000,"02 4, 2013"

"On one summer night, while I was quickly flipping channels on my television to see if anything good was on, I saw that a movie called The Mexican was going to begin.  Although I had never seen the film, I knew about the stars and though I never really admired them, I decided to give it a chance.  By the end of the two longest hours it took me to watch the film (wait, Battlefield Earth was even longer) I was highly disappointed that I had even bothered to watch such a horrible and boring film that tried to catch my attention numerous times but failed every time.Despite it having two superstars in the film industry, the Mexican is a film that is not worth seeing plainly because it is uninteresting and has nothing special in it.  More on the actual movie coming up later.  But for now: Plot.Brad Pitt takes on the role of Jerry Welbach, a man working for some weird agency.  Jerry plans to have a honeymoon or something with his girlfriend Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) but an unexpected change of plans forces him to go to Mexico to retrieve a gun called the Mexican (hence the film's title).  Unfortunately for Jerry, someone steals the gun from him and it's up to him to get back.  Meanwhile, Samantha is kidnapped by gay hitman Winston Baldry (played by James Gandolfini from TV's The Sopranos), who plans to get back at Jerry for some reason.  Jerry now has a whole lot to accomplish:  Getting the gun back, saving his girlfriend, and winning her heart back.  The rest of the movie shows the journey that Jerry embarks on and though the plot sounds interesting, the actual movie isn't.I don't really know if this movie is to be considered a comedy for there was complete silence while I watched it and my mouth never opened.  Okay, maybe for a cough but never for a laugh.  I don't know what the screenwriter was thinking when he wrote the screenplay but I feel that he was ashamed when he saw how terrible the movie is.  Not one joke, not one laugh.  Main Point:  This is not a comedy.  The film is probably a mix of romance (85% percent of the film) and thriller (15% percent) because it has a couple shootouts which might satisfy action fans.  Otherwise, I don't really know who to recommend this film to.The performances are good though Gandolfini steals the movie away with his brilliant portrayal of Winston Baldry.  He probably was cast because of his role on the Sopranos (or the other way around) but I don't think they should have made him gay because that doesn't make any impact on the film.  Julia Roberts gives her typical performance, where she always gets the good man in the end and lives happily ever after with him.  Though there's a sign through the film that she's falling for Gandolfini's character, it's a bit predictable of who she'll end up with.  Brad Pitt delivers an average performance as the person trying to win the girl of his dreams.  Again, it makes the film more predictable and the ending is spoiled from the very beginning.The biggest problem with the film is the longness.  The film is completely boring because instead of relying on plot twists to surprise the viewer, the script just enlarges one idea and adds more time to the film.  I feel that instead of the 123 minutes that took the film to explain every little thing, the screenwriter could have stuck to the little things and made it a plain 100 minute film.Overall, the Mexican is definetely a must-not buy.  However, if it's ever on TV, you should probably check it out.  Beware, though, boredness is coming from the very first minute.",1043625600,"01 27, 2003"

I am sending mine back for a refund and you should be very careful to be sure any discs you buy say region 1 or A in North America. Too bad too because there are a lot of extras, although the transfers on the other films are not so good but then again it's not an official north american release and not subject to the same standards.",1385683200,"11 29, 2013"
"Although it is not always the case, most of my friends who like elaborate science fiction movies do not like low budget horror flicks and vice versa.My sci fi friends like detailed story lines, (somewhat) believable technology type devices/theories, and a little bit of humor helps too. My budget horror flick friends prefer something that scares the poop out of them every few minutes and the less plausible the storyline with moronic characters the better chance to do this (otherwise the movie drags).This movie is like some idiot in hollywood thought it would be a great idea to give a low budget horror flick director/writer a chance to make a sci fi movie.None of my friends liked this movie for this very reason.Sci fi friends found the alien invasion premise and technical weapons/tactics nonsensical and the military characters stereotypical cookie cut actors (not believable). My budget horror flick friends thought the aliens were not scary at all, the human characters boring, and most of all, the movie was a real drag. Having no humor in the movie did not help.Both groups felt the people who created this movie had no original thoughts of their own and possibly were on crack when they wrote this thing up.

The only character I liked (besides Maureen) was the dog.  The dog, without a collar, rides in the back of a truck down a highway.  The ASPCA must have been asleep during that portion of film making.  I don't get why the dog didn't get upset when his master was being attacked.  My toy poodle gaps at a leaf blowing around.

"Episodes like these are what make Doctor Who about as embarrassing to watch as ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"". Which is a pity because Sylvester McCoy turned out to be an excellent Doctor in his following season. And the customer who said Mel was better than Peri needs to get their head examined. This is probably, if not, the worst first episode for a Doctor beating out ""The Twin Dilemma"" by a country mile. The Rani has hijacked the TARDIS causing the Doctor to regenerate (apparently he bumps his head during the fall) and mistakes the Rani for his companion Mel. How I'm not sure. ... Rani's plan is to use the Doctor's genius in this giant brain she's constructed with all the genius's throughout time and space to rule the galaxy. Again, it's better not to ask. But if you are wanting to check out Sylvester McCoy's episodes for the first time, I recommend ""Greatest Show in the Galaxy"", ""Happiness Patrol"", ""Battlefield"", ""Ghostlight"" or ""Survival"".

"I was drawn to seeing Aeon Flux, because the trailer provided a few impressive action scenes and I am very interested in seeing the participations of three Oscar-nominated/winning actresses teaming up in this Sci-fi action ""chick flick"". I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.",1133740800,"12 5, 2005"
"Can't choose on this one.  Both releases have splicy dialogue and missing snippets of footage here and there.

"Certainly aimed at someone looking for a step-class style workout.  She does introduce bellydance movements and compose combinations but they are probably not the sort of combinations would take with you to the dance floor.  She will give you combinations of about 4 eight-counts a piece and you will repeat them over and over for the length of a song.  Rania is a very beautiful dancer so I expected a little more.Even as a workout, they were pretty slow, I didn't feel like I had worked up to cardiovascular benefit personally (I am 25 but I am not sure if that makes a whole lot of difference).There are some performance peices on the dvd but the Bellydance Superstars dvd has better ones, in my opinion.If you want to spice up your step-class workout- you might enjoy these but if you are hoping to learn how to bellydance, I would recommend something else.",1164326400,"11 24, 2006"

"This Crosby double feature is a fair example of the programmers which Paramount churned out in the thirties and early forties for the famous crooner. Both are pleasant entertainment and each contain a few memorable and some unintentionally funny moments.""Rhythm on the Range"" released in 1936, is clearly based on ""It Happened One Night"" with the intelligent and stunning Frances Farmer as the runaway heiress. Bing is miscast as a cowboy of sorts. Since Farmer has been urged to find a ""real man"" by her rather butch aunt, it is unintentionally funny that Crosby, with middle age spread and a notable lack of masculine prowess, becomes the object of her affections. There are other funny moments: for example, that shadow of the horse trainer visible in the rodeo when Bing sings and the arc light shone like a halo over Farmer in every scene. The songs are mainly duds sung with little gusto by Bing. The good moments are Martha Raye singing her signature tune ""Mr Paganini"" and everyone having a go at ""I'm an Old Cowhand"".""Rhythm of the River"" is a much better film with Bing more suitably cast as a ghost song writer for Basil Rathbone. Mary Martin plays the lyricist and as always, she impresses with her warmth, humour and delightful vocals. The script has bite, not surprising since Billy Wilder is listed in the credits and there is at least one memorable moment when Bing sings the title song in a pawn shop.Both films' scripts refer to Bing as a young man at least once and this is ludicrous since he clearly was not. Thank goodness Bob Hope turned up to galvanise him into animation in the Road Pictures.The prints are immaculate and there are no extras which is OK since this is not an expensive DVD.",1190419200,"09 22, 2007"
"As a very young girl, (approx 3 yrs old or younger) I watched this movie and the Black Stallion.I have always loved horses, but watching this struck me so deeply.  The relationship between human and horse was so beautiful.I knew at that young age that I wanted to ride, train, work with horses.Now as an equine professional I am still struck by the relationship these movies portray.  Every rider dreams of having a relationship like thag with a horse. Most never get it.  I was lucky enough to have have had it with a Thoroughbred.  I was a pre-teen when I met him.  And he chose me as his human. It really was like a story. So to honor Rev I am now writing a novel about our years together.  It's a true story, and I am honored to have had this experience to share.So thank you Walter Farley for your stories of The Black.  And thank you to those who made these movies.

"Queen Christina opposes her advisors, who relish war and want to choose her husband. She flees the royal life, is mistaken as a man and falls in love with a fellow traveller. Conflict ensues when she returns to the palace. [Because Garbos persona in real life exhibited both masculine and feminine characteristics, this mistaken perception was believable.] I appreciate Greta Garbo in her silent films, and in those films she is marvelous. Queen Christina is considered by many to be her best film. In her talking pictures Garbos voice is low, and she speaks with an accent. Her acting is also, at times, stiff and unnatural. She has, though, some very powerful moments as an actress in this film. The film is very good, Garbo is beautiful and spellbinding, and one who appreciates film should see it.

"T-MEN(1947)---Dennis O'Keefe, Wallace Ford, Charles McGraw, Mary MeadeThis is a fine, gritty, film noir, directed by Anthony Mann and filmed by John Alton. It's done in a ""semi-documentary"" style, with periodic ""voiceovers"" explaining to the viewer how the Treasury Department does its job---the film does for the Treasury Department what, THE STREET WITH NO NAME, did for the FBI. Dennis O'Keefe plays a ""T-Man"" who goes undercover with a partner in order to break up a counterfeiting ring. Although the ""voiceovers"" become a little tiresome, the movie is well-paced and the plot is engrossing. Wallace Ford is good as a sleazy little guy known as, ""The Schemer"", who overestimates his ability to ""scheme"" his way out of things. Charles McGraw is excellent as a vicious hood---but then, that's his forte, isn't it! Naturally, after a few close calls, O'Keefe succeeds in bringing down the counterfeiters. This is a good film and I highly recommend it to fans of noir.",1257638400,"11 8, 2009"

"Dave Buznik (Sandler) is a self-loathing businessman who is wrongly sentenced to an anger-management program, where he meets an unorthodox instructor, Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson).  Dr. Buddy decides it would be in Dave's best interests if he were under strict observation for 30 days...this means living together.Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Sounds about as likely a pairing as Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller...oh...wait. Anyway, Anger Management is a typical Sandler comedy; complete with repetitive jokes, raunchy humor, and a cheesy ending. Only through the curious casting of Nicholson, his grand presence and comedic know-how, does Anger Management elevate itself above most of Sandler's previous work.The pairing of Nicholson and Sandler is quite unique given their body of work and acting styles. However, I did feel that they worked well together on screen. Where else can you see these two different men sing ""I Feel Pretty"" from West Side Story? Some of Anger Management's jokes do wear a little thin, but I found it to be genuinely amusing at times, particularly Sandler and Nicholson's encounter with a wrestler-like monk.",1051056000,"04 23, 2003"

"For the actual cinematic qualities, see Roland E. Zwick's excellent review.  Short version:  it doesn't work all that well, because it is dry and wooden.OK, so the medium is lacking.  What about the message?Well, you get to review bad war leadership decisions from the Bush administration.  Who knew?In the Streep/Cruise thread, Cruise very much ends up being the straw man, but gets to put his case across very eloquently.  Merryl Streep often challenges him, but without pressing her arguments (hint: she's doing it for the audience).  When she does really object, it is not with him, but rather with her news manager.  I guess a central point Cruise makes would be hard to answer:  what would exactly happens if the US cuts and runs now?And that's the whole weakness on the foreign policy side:  it criticizes but doesn't manage to even try to articulate an answer.  Or indeed even ask novel and important questions, as it doesn't rise much above canned, though valid, criticism.Where it does come up with its own ideas, through Redford's character, it proposes a woolly, likely useless agenda about an in-USA-Peace-Corps that has absolutely nothing to do with Afghanistan/Iraq.  And it laments the supposed stupidity, ignorance and apathy of the voters.  Original that.  And with just a whiff of elitism.In the end, the best thing about the movie is its title.  It refers to WWI German soldiers admiring the doomed courage of British soldiers at the Battle of the Somme, while they were lead by an incompetent top leadership.  That pretty much summarizes Iraq and Afghanistan 6 years on, though the failures are much less at the military than at the political level.I applaud Robert Redford for trying to wake folks up, but this ain't 'Apocalypse Now', 'Deer Hunter' or even 'Three Kings' in terms of cinema quality or mass appeal.

"It's amazing how  the basic Terminator storyline can still generate some dramatic tension almost 20 years since its introduction. I sat there in the theater noticing the  similiarities in all three movies: the arrival of the two warriors, one sent to kill, the other sent to protect (this time I noticed they arrived in large disco balls), and then the introduction of the character who's at the center of all the fuss. The tension mounts as they both hunt for John Connor simultaneously, culminating in the initial action scene. It's almost predictable what will happen, but I was still engaged even though I had seen this setup twice before.  I guess it shows how well done the original story was for a sci-fi action movie.And the  initial action  sequence was incredible. Part of me was enthralled; the other part of me was wondering how the city of L.A. let the producers of the film destroy so much stuff. A lot of it looked like it was filmed on location. This chase scene was equal to (or better than?) the one in The Matrix Reloaded mostly because of the sheer destruction, and the concept of the Terminatrix controlling multiple vehicles.  But I wasn't as impressed with this new Terminator; it was like a cross between the T-1000 and Inspector Gadget. It had a ""been there, done that"" feel  to the special effects. I also liked Robert Patrick's portrayal of the T-1000 better. He almost seemed like an animal, hunting and sensing his environment, where Kristana Loken's Terminatrix came off like a pissed-off smug model at a nightclub.Then the plot contrivances kicked in and I began to wince. I was wondering how they were going to justify the arrival of the Terminatrix since T2 ended with such a strong sense of finality. They destroyed Cyberdine systems and skynet before its inception and stopped the nuclear war! Where could you go from there? Arnold saying, ""you didn't stop it, you merely postponed it"" wasn't satisfying enough. They never showed how they continued the work of Cyberdine. Skynet was just up and running at the beginning of this movie. And the fact that Skynet sent yet another Terminator, which was even better than the T-1000, was wholly unoriginal. How did it find the time to create and send those new Terminators even though it was basically defeated?But that really isn't my main gripe. My main gripe is that it didn't have James Cameron's touch for action movie storytelling. James Cameron is one of the best action movie writer/directors not because he could blow stuff up, but because he was able to write in just enough back story and characterization so when the action occurred, it was more dramatic. The characters of Ripley from Aliens and Sarah Connor from T2 were fleshed out so there was an emotional attachment for the audience. The introduction of John Connor's wife was interesting, but in the end she seemed like another doe-eyed person thrown into the action. The running times of both T2 and Aliens were over 2 hours and 20 minutes because James Cameron gave enough time to set up dramatic action and create strong characterization (well good enough for an action movie). T3 had a running time of approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes.Maybe the producers of T3 thought the only thing needed for a Terminator movie was a recycling of the basic plot and throw in more advanced special effects. But T2 and the original also carried some emotional resonance as well. Therefore when this movie ended I was able to get up quickly and head out to the shopping mall.",1057708800,"07 9, 2003"

"The two logos are the ghastly logo for ""Entertainment Rights"", whatever that is, which looks like Soviet People's Art, and the excellent Ghostbusters logo which doesn't appear on the box but is on the enclosed booklet. As usual, I differ with whoever designed the packaging, since the moaning ghost logo which began and ended the shows, and was used for bumpers (see the special features) was one of the best parts of the show.Ghostbusters was remarkable for about a million reasons. It was a show, as Filmation producer Lou Scheimer notes, in which everything came together. What that really means is that it's a live action show done on the miniscule cartoon budgets that were standard for kids' TV. It was written very fast, as cartoons are. It starred a likable, humorous cast: Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch of F- Troop, who essentially played the same parts as F-Troop and as in their cartoon voice over work. The amazing addition was Bob Burns, who plays the most lifelike gorilla probably ever seen on TV. The show is a ghostbusting take on Gangbusters, with a vaguely '20s feel: Larry dresses the part, Forrest doesn't). As the theme song says, ""I'm Spenser, he's Tracy, I'm Kong. You'd think Kong would be the gorilla; he's not. Tracy is the gorilla. Forest is Kong.There are only three sets: a graveyard, a haunted house hallway, and a room in the creepy house. The guest stars read like a whose who of (then) current television. As with cartoon voiceovers, kids' shows are wildly popular with adult actors who get to let out their kid side. Brilliantly, however, the show never played down to its audience. Kids don't need to ""get it"". They don't need to follow the plot. They relate to the characters and want to be in on the action. This is why it's so tragic that live hosts are gone. They are the natural ones to show cartoons, and form an immediate bond with kids.Ghostbusters brilliantly worked a number of repeating schticks. Every episode Spenser and Tracy would drive their old '20s car to a junk shop to get their assignment, Mission Impossible/ Get Smart style from a different unlikely object, which after playing the tape would self- destruct in five seconds. Tracy would hold it and count down in the repeating gag. Another is that Tracy would don a variety of hats, some relevant to the plot, some not. He never spoke but he grunted in a meaningful way, drew doodles and did charades to get his ideas across, and dragged an assortment of props for visual gags onto the sets. The show's credits say ""Tracy trained by Bob Burns,"" so kids thought he really was a gorilla. Burns is also known for his vast collection of sci-fi memorabilia (see the book Blast Off). One of the best extra features in this set is the interview with Burns, although the interview with Scheimer is also good.One not very great extra is an episode of Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon, which is unwatchably bad for reasons that many mid- eighties cartoons are bad. Ten years after this 1974-5 Live action show, Ghostbusters, came the 1984 Bill Murray Ghostbusters blockbuster film. I wondered then how the movie could use the same title. The conflict came during the cartoon spin-offs. DIC's The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, spun off from the movie, ran in 1986. The same year, Filmation made a cartoon version of the live action show. DIC's is by far the better cartoon because they had the comic trio from the film (mostly voiced by Arsenio Hall) as cartoon stars. Filmation's show suffered from bland, badly drawn human characters which, for whatever reason, bore no resemblance to Storch or Tucker, nor for that matter, did the gorilla to Tracy. Despite that, the closing titles feature lavish surrealistic backgrounds, testimony to the uneven artistry of mid- '80s cartoons.However, to return to the live action show, in the last episode, the song on the radio is ""Sugar Sugar"", the number one charting song by The Archies, which came from Filmation's 1968 The Archie Show. But here Filmation started with great human characters: the gang from Riverdale. Those doing Cartoons Without Cable will find Ghostbusters a wonderful change from cartoons. Play one episode along with a favorite cartoon like Garfield and Friends to make a great hour of kids' TV. There are only fifteen episodes, but Ink and Paint has done a great job with this budget set, which consists of two double- sided discs in a slip case with credits and copious notes. There's even a computer ROM feature that enables you to read all the scripts. A blast from the past recalling a magic moment when great hearts made great kids' TV.",1184803200,"07 19, 2007"
Great movie. I love this movie.,1494979200,"05 17, 2017"
"The sword and sorcery genre that emerged in the early 1980s produced some good movies and even more bad ones. ""Conan the Barbarian,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger's big break, serves as one of the better examples. In fact, his movie kicked off the Hollywood quest to run every successful new idea into the ground. And so they did, producing and distributing average fare like Albert Pyun's ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" and the atrocious ""The Warrior and the Sorceress."" Starring the inestimable David Carradine--still recovering from his stint on ""Kung Fu"" in the 1970s--""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" is schlock filmmaking at its cheesy worst. Carradine, whose weird public life is well documented, is one of those actors I have difficulty accepting fully. He does excellent work from time to time, but from the mid 1970s well into the 1980s (and perhaps, some would argue, into the present) he starred in loads of low budget films like Larry Cohen's ""Q,"" ""Deathsport,"" and ""Death Race 2000."" Undoubtedly, many of these films delight on some level yet they are hardly monuments to epic filmmaking. ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" falls well below this category, a movie even fans of the sword and sorcery genre should forget.""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" resembles Albert Pyun's ""Omega Doom,"" which in turn is a rip off of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film ""Yojimbo."" It is amazing there are still filmmakers who will copy this film (Omega Doom was made in the late 1990s), but such is life. Why come up with a new idea when an old one will still draw in the dupes? I actually saw a few things to like in Pyun's effort. I saw little to enjoy in ""The Warrior and the Sorceress."" David Carradine plays Kain (!), a knight of sorts from some defunct society of guardians who now roams the blasted landscapes of a destroyed world. He stumbles into a little village--no more than two fortresses, actually--where two warlords battle it out for possession of a well. Each leader is more or less evenly matched in men and supplies, leading to a frustrating stalemate that wily tricks and epic plans of action rarely overcome for long. The only real losers in this battle are the hapless gaggle of townspeople who must beg and scrimp for a mouthful of the precious water. We don't really know what is going on at first, and frankly, we just as quickly realize we don't care to know. Yes, it is that bad, but don't worry your head about it. By the time this clunker grinds to a halt, you will be able to endure anything life may throw at you.Kain adroitly plays both warlords off each other. He approaches the warlord Bal Caz, a fat, grinning fool who keeps a talking lizard creature near at hand (!) and offers his services for a sack of gold. At the first opportunity, Kain defects to the other warlord, Zeg the Tyrant, for a similar sack of gold. Kain flip-flops back and forth, stirring up loads of trouble amongst the two rivals paid for in the blood of their underlings. From time to time a mob of slavers turns up to wreak havoc on the village, another group the knight uses to shake things up. The film reaches a painful nadir when Kain battles a ""monster"" in a prison cell, a special effect that looks like it was made out of giant pipe cleaners. What's the purpose of this exercise? Perhaps Kain wishes to democratize the village by freeing the townspeople of these murderous thugs so the water will quench more thirsts. Maybe he wants to make a load of money. Since there is a sorceress involved--a woman named Naja who stumbles around in the buff all the time--who makes vague allusions to some magical sword every chance she gets, perhaps Kain is merely seeking a grand weapon. It's all so cheesily done, so gratingly banal, that I could care less about Kain's motives. Even a ""brutal"" drowning, an amusing strip scene, and the battle sequences at the conclusion can't make this turkey fly.""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" fails on every level of moviemaking imaginable: the acting is laughable, the script should have been burned, the set pieces are a joke, and the pace absolutely drags. I think the movie only runs about eighty or so minutes but it felt like eons. Carradine looks embarrassed to be in this mess, and I cannot blame him when I think back to some of the humiliating scenes in the movie. Case in point: at the end of the film, a big battle rages over the water supply. The townspeople finally rise up to assert their rights and attack the soldiers standing guard over the well. Clearly visible are people falling down well after they were supposed to die. Ouch. It is this type of production values that elevate ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" to the apex of mediocrity. Director John C. Broderick must have considered falling on his boom mike when he realized he crafted a disaster epic instead of an action film.If you like a challenge, pick up the DVD version of the film. There isn't a lot in the way of extras, predictably, but there are a mess of sword and sorcery trailers for films like ""Barbarian Queen"" and several others. Many of these trailers point out a central fact concerning this particular film genre: sword and sorcery equals high cheese. If the makers of these films had aimed for camp, it might have been worth the effort. As it is, they now stand as monuments to inept filmmaking, and ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" stands towards the top of the mountain in that regard.",1074729600,"01 22, 2004"

"Amitabh Bachchan---the naked soul.  That's his secret.  The voice is wonderful but the eyes far more eloquent.  This man surely must be the greatest actor on the planet.  And what he brings to the role of Vijay in this movie is astonishing. Even though I don't know much Hindi, I get all his later movies,[ even those that don't have subtitles]  because Bachchan makes you understand everything. People who don't. appreciate or understand this film either don't like romantic feelings between the generations or can't comprehend why they happen. ""Nishabd"" tries to explain and I think does a wonderful job.  The wife was miscast, though, although she acquitted herself well.  Young women playing older ones is fine on the stage, but the camera is too exacting.  There are plenty of seasoned Indian actresses who still look good enough to make it believable that a very handsome man like Vijay would have chosen them.  Or perhaps they didn't like the part--who knows?  Marriages go stale and little can be done about it.

I will say this is where the game designers of the fallout series got a lot of there ideas from ,such as the Glowing ones. Also there is rape and rape innuendo in this film as society and law has completely broken down and law is a bullet from a gun with a cesspool town being the only safe zone if you can call it that with all the sex obsessed crazies inhabiting it in the film plot.

"Why anyone would have thought it was a good idea to remake ""The Big Bounce,"" an utterly unmemorable 1969 caper comedy (based on an Elroy Leonard novel), is a complete mystery to me.  Owen Wilson takes over the role of Jack Ryan (originally played by Ryan O'Neal), a petty crook who has some issues with his ex-boss, Ray Ritchie, a corrupt real estate developer in Hawaii.  Hooking up with Ritchie's bombshell mistress, Ryan comes up with a scheme to rob the big man of a couple hundred thousand dollars.  Ryan is also befriended by an anti-Ritchie judge named Walter Crewes, for reasons that make almost no sense at all until the closing moments.  As in all films of this type, Ryan soon learns that people are not always what they appear to be and that the conning game can work both ways.  Actually, if the truth be told, Ryan is remarkably stupid for a con man.The pacing of this film is almost shockingly bad.  The story plods along for a good hour or so before the inevitable plot twists begin to kick in.  Then, when they finally arrive, they are so poorly worked out and explained that you will probably be scratching your head wondering what it was that just happened - if you still care that is.  The attitude on the part of both the filmmakers and the actors is so lackadaisical and indifferent that the film is really an insult to the audience who is paying good money to sit through this mess.  In addition to Wilson, the film wastes the considerable talents of Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Willie Nelson, Harry Dean Stanton, Sara Foster and Gary Sinise, among others, all of whom at least got a trip to Hawaii out of the deal.

"David S. Goyer had written the first two ""Blade"" films and co-wrote ""Batman Begins"" with Christopher Nolan so I gave him an excuse for his lackluster directorial efforts in ""Blade Trinity"" and ""the Invisible"". Now that was before I found out that Goyer is also responsible for the script in ""Kickboxer 2: the Road Back"". Certainly, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that Goyer is a either a hit or a miss after his less than stellar resume. He has written and directed his latest horror film ""The UNBORN"", and once again, I wonder as to what happened to the talent displayed in the first two ""Blade"" films?Casey (sexy Odette Yustman) is experiencing several bizarre and unsettling dreams. What's more casey had began to experience hallucinations and she had come to believe that a child named ""jumby"" is a guise for a demonic force called the `Dyubbuk' and that malevolent spirit is after her. Casey traces the cause of the visions through the clues left behind by her dead mother (Carla Gugino) and had found that she is also the grandchild of a holocaust survivor, Sofi (Jane Alexander). Sofi had experienced unfathomable experiences as a child during the holocaust and she believes that the `Dyubbuk' is after Casey. The demonic force slowly becomes more powerful as people around Casey begin to die. Now it is up to her along with her boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) to seek the help of Rabbi Sendak (Gary Oldman) to exorcise the `dyubbuk' and send it back to where it belongs....""The Unborn"" could have easily been mistaken for a remake of an Asian horror film; a creepy child--check, a pale-faced ghost--check, a family curse--check, a malevolent spirit--check. Yes, ""The Unborn"" has all the makings of a simple ghost story and David Goyer does try to go for a different route and adds several elements of Jewish mysticism such as the Kabbalah, family curses and even Nazi experimentation. The film does attempt to cover a lot of ground, that results in the film becoming a little too unfocused. Goyer's skills as a director isn't finely honed enough to pull off such an ambition and he is left a little lost within his own writing. I do commend the fact that Hollywood horror has tried to do something different in the film, rather than resorting to another remake; it also attempts to bring certain exorcism procedures into exposition than resorting to the usual Catholic overtones.The problems with ""The Unborn"" are the fact that it throws in too many ideas but never really uses one as its central theme. What results is a screenplay full of gaping plot holes and too many variables that falter as a misstep. It also shows Casey trying to battle the forces of evil that feels like a minor genre implementation that ends up with the script becoming convoluted. It's not that the film made no effort to explain everything, it actually does but it ends up spending too much time trying to make sense of each of its plot elements that the film loses any of the `creep-out' touches it may have achieved.The film is also co-produced by Michael Bay so expect a very visual experience that is a rehearsed practice of cheap and ""jump"" scares. The special effects do look very good and the film itself looks very pretty. There are a number of freaky images such as an old man crawling around distorting his own body, facial features are changed into something more feral and scary, convulsions and creepy mirrors--the film does have its moments, but the problem is the scare factor feels a little too cheap. The film suffers from visual overload, it is loud (not in a literary sense) with too much style that it forgot to become scary. Characterization is also a little too weak, and the viewer would have no time to get attached to its characters. Some may like the ""in-your-face-no-nonsense"" type of storytelling, but in a horror film, caring for the characters is essential. Goyer forgot to make the audience settle into his screenplay.Goyer also leaves some grand behavioral missteps as with the character of Casey's friend Romy (Meagan Good); for someone who talks about believing in the occult, she sure spends an awful lot of time trying to convince Casey otherwise. He also leaves the subplot with Casey's child-stalker hanging out to dry and Casey's dad is curiously nowhere to be found amid the entire crisis (a simple phone call would've sufficed). Instead, the direction obsesses in showing a pale-faced deformed dog, more visual nightmares and an upside down senior citizen than developing the script. The acting is also a mixed bag and given the little elements the cast had to work with, I can`t really judge their acting abilities. Although I really liked the sight of Odette Yustman in her small shirt and panties, plus I did somewhat enjoy the fact that Gary Oldman managed to kick some dyubbuk butt.""The Unborn"" throws in so much substance than it actually really needs. It resulted with the storytelling becoming a little too convoluted and the special effects just taking over that made the film rather superficial. While it does have some freaky images, they were all pretty routine and it offers nothing methodical that may make a scene really stand out--it all seems like a rehearsed exercise. The film is a grand exhibit of too much style and substance that never went anywhere. But I am pretty sure that ""The Unborn"" may find an audience, but hardcore horror fans are better off staying away. At least, Odette Yustman is very hot.Rent it.

"If you love Monk's recordings you can't afford not to own this. Here is Monk performing many of his classics in a variety of settings in addition to a very well edited documentary. The non-performance clips do much to shed light on Monk's personality and includes interviews with Charlie Rouse and T. Monk Jr. I thought the sections with his son , while brief, were very touching and revealing of the private struggles that Monk went through.This may not have as much appeal to those who are unfamiliar with the mans' musical contributions but it is a fine film and a wonderful tribute to a true giant.",1092787200,"08 18, 2004"

"I love Denzel's acting.  And it was also nice to see a TV series I used to watch starring the talented Edward Woodward being made into a feature film.  Denzel's character actually is named for Woodward's character.  The Equalizer was very entertaining.  In it Denzel was a retired spy who'd obviously made a promise to his deceased wife that he would stay out of the spy game, but broke that promise when he saw someone in trouble.  He's a stand-up guy.  A guy with specialized skills.  The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  The supporting cast was good.  All in all, a very satisfying action film that I'll be watching again.",1425513600,"03 5, 2015"
"THE FLY is one of those rare 1950s-era flicks that successfully combines the science fiction and horror genres into a genuinely literate and, yes, scary piece of entertainment.  The pseudo-scientific babble may seem less plausible in light of the advancements in genetics that have occurred since 1958, but the script is tight and the story gripping, the acting is top-notch, and the creepy spider-web scene still manages to haunt viewers long after the movie has ended.By now, of course, the basic plot of this film is well known.  When a scientist experimenting with the electronic teleportation of matter uses himself as a guinea pig, some of his atoms are inadvertently mixed with those of a housefly that has managed to sneak into the machinery with him, and the result is quite a pesky problem for the scientist, his loving wife, and his milquetoast brother.Vincent Price delivers one of his best performances ever in THE FLY.  More restrained and earnest than in his later wonderful but over-the-top performances of the '60s and 70's, Price is very affecting as Francois Delambre, a meek businessman who, in coping with his brother's hideous accident, must comfort his sister-in-law while staving off the overzealous police.  The beautiful Patricia Owens gives a strong performance as Helene Delambre, a woman who finds the inner strength she needs to protect her husband, even though protecting him might also mean destroying him.  And David Hedison, as scientist Andre Delambre, and Herbert Marshall, as Inspector Charas, also do quite adequately.Even after almost 45 years, the special effects in THE FLY hold up quite well.  Although the depiction of computers is a bit outdated, the teleporation effects are very convincing.  They are just flashy enough to give a sense of technological wonder, but restrained enough to avoid that  garish visual hyperbole common to a lot of '50s sci-fi.  So, too, with the make-up effect for the human-fly hybrid.  It is quite realistic and eerie, and it still manages to shock modern viewers in spite of all the amazing advancements in cinema make-up that have taken place since.There are, of course, the inevitable comparisons with David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the film.  Cronenberg's version is admittedly more in-tune with modern scientific knowledge.  Also, his special effects are more modern and very realistic, and his actors are superb working with a script that is quite literate.  But in many ways the original 1958 version is much more engaging, and it has a climax that is, psychologically speaking, much creepier.  Cronenberg's film may be a masterpiece of modern sci-fi horror, but the 1958 version of THE FLY is undoubtedly a classic.This DVD version of THE FLY comes paired with 1959's THE RETURN OF THE FLY.  In spite the presence of Price in a reprise of his role in the original film, this sequel is far inferior to the first.  The story is weak, the special effects are cheesy, and, with the exception of Price, the acting is sub-par. However, the DVD is very modestly priced, making it worth purchasing just to get original THE FLY.",1005782400,"11 15, 2001"

"This movie starts off great. The first half hour is very entertaining. There is great attention to detail in making a 70's style camp movie. Greta Gerwig's character is utterly entertaining and tension builds nicely. Then somewhere around the 30-minute mark, everything falls apart. The tension is replaced by boring, ultra-long drawn out wanderings through the hallways and rooms of the house, Greta Gerwig disappears and nothing, I mean NOTHING happens!! If they edited out about 45 minutes of the middle of this film and cut right to the chase this would be an excellent 50-minute TV scare show episode.

"""Clockstoppers"" seems perfectly designed to appeal to the pre- and early-adolescent audience that is so obviously its target.  It offers a clever gimmick, cool special effects, teenage heroes, puppy-love romance, a blaring rock soundtrack and even a mildly dysfunctional father/son relationship to help give the film its requisite patina of ""social relevance.""  Adults, on the other hand - for all the reasons listed above - may well wish they could ""hypertime"" themselves through most of this tale about a crazy watch that has the power to stop time dead in its tracks.For a concept like this to really work (as it did in, say, ""Back to the Future""), it has to be developed using a great deal of ingenuity and creativity.  That is definitely not the case here.  Indeed, the writers, once having come up with the gimmick, seem to have no idea what on earth to do with it for the hour and a half that the film is required to run.  Predictably, when the youngsters discover the extraordinary power of the object in their possession, they spend most of their time using it to play dumb practical jokes on the unsuspecting citizens living in their obviously studio back lot town.  Then, when the novelty of that wears off, the filmmakers trap them in a tedious plot involving stereotypical rule-the-world villains and kidnappers who are bent on retrieving the watch even if it means liquidating all the main characters in the process.""Clockstoppers"" works well enough for prepubescent audiences primarily because both the violence and the lovemaking are kept on a purely prophylactic level (there's also no bad language in the movie).  I suppose I must applaud the moviemakers for that.  Yet, the film, just as assuredly, offers little that will interest anyone over the age of 15.",1029456000,"08 16, 2002"

"I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.",1395273600,"03 20, 2014"

"I love the Lord of the Rings books and movies, and so first and foremost, as a huge fan, this movie is a wonderful return visit to the fantasy world of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  But the process of watching the movie proved to be a chore as it became apparent that Sir PJ (Peter Jackson) had burdened this movie with some terrible film making decisions.First the good parts - Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, the key new actors playing the young Bilbo and Thorin Oakenshield, are outstanding!!  Andy Serkis does another fabulous turn as the twisted and tortured Gollum - his scenes with Martin Freeman playing the riddle game are worth the price of admission/DVD/BluRay alone!!  Ian McClellan is wonderful as always as Gandalf, and Cate Blanchett has never been so lustrous and beautiful as the elf queen Galadriel.  Ian Holm as the older Bilbo, Elijah Woods as Frodo, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond all make reassuring reappearances.  (Christopher Lee's reappearance as Saruman is a bit redundant).  Manu Bennett (Crixus the gladiator in the Spartacus series) does a fine job as Azog the pale Orc.The many, many battle scenes in this movie are awesome.The back stories of the dwarves, how they lost their kingdom under the mountains and how their enmity with the elves began, is told in rich detail, one of the key benefits to  ""The Hobbit"" getting stretched out into three parts.So what were the bad parts about the movie? And how could anybody accuse Sir PJ of bad film making?The bad part of stretching a small book like The Hobbitt out like this clearly are the slow and overly long padded parts such as the introduction of the dwarves  and Radagast the Brown's long segment.However, the biggest complaint of many movie critics has been how cheesy and unnatural this movie looks.  Nobody so far has clearly explained why, so here is my analysis.I watched this movie in 3D IMAX in 48fps.  Very simply, 48fps is a fine technology - it makes everything much clearer, and cleaner and does not make you vomit.  People who do not understand film making technology have unfairly blamed the many technical ills of this movie on 48fps.  It is NOT the culprit.The real culprit, what did make my stomach churn (and I do not get sick easily from watching movies with jittery camerawork) was Sir PJ's excessive use of camera motion in the vast majority of scenes in this movie.  Even simple close up shots of individuals engaged in conversation were framed by unnecessary dipping and panning camera movements!!!This was not the jittery handheld camera motion of documentary style movies like the Blair Witch Project.  These were PLANNED camera moves, done for stylistic purpose, no more.  Terrible, awful film maker's choice.What made this worse was the fact that these excessive, often useless camera movements appeared to be SPEEDED UP, as if somebody had hit the ""fast forward"" button on the movie all of a sudden and it was playing at 2x or 4x normal speed during those camera moves.Indeed, I suspect that what may have happened was that as Sir PJ realized that this movie was going to end up at nearly 3 hours long and that he had ONLY SHOT some of his key scenes with this extra camera movement,  that he needed to speed things up a bit and so he probably did fast forward through those scenes with the camera moves.Another problem  I started to notice - the digital lighting effects.  In previous DVD/BluRays, Sir PJ and his minions had explained their extensive use of digital post processing to enhance and correct for the unevenness of their filming, especially lighting effects.  With ""The Hobbit"" captured entirely by ultra-high resolution digital cameras, the end movie appears to have been post-processed to the max.The excessiveness of the post-processing, this attempt to make every scene appear digitally picture postcard ""perfect"" becomes apparent when viewing the scenes as a whole.  The scenes end up looking completely unnatural in appearance, very similar in ""look"" to what you get with TV soap operas, which are typically shot indoors in studio sets with multiple soft light sources that eliminate shadows,  poorly lit dark areas, overly bright reflections, and imperfect colors.As a result, very strangely, the most plastic and fake looking scenes in this move were the Hobbiton outdoor scenes, which were all filmed outdoors, on real, naturally created sets, and yet looked like an indoor TV studio set BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SHADOWS ANYWHERE AND THE DIGITALLY PERFECT LIGHTING WAS PERFECTLY DIFFUSE.  I noticed this as I was watching the movie and started looking for shadows in those scenes.  When I couldn't find any, I looked at the sky to see if there were a heavy dark total overcast of clouds blotting out the sun, but no, the sky was blue and bright.  And look carefully at Gandalf in every outdoor scene - wearing his broad brimmed hat, his face should always be in the shadows, and yet invariably, his face is unnaturally and brightly lit by a magical and cartoonish lighting while the bottom of his hat sits in total darkness.Sir PJ's  technical choices for this movie were clearly made with a film maker's zeal to do more, not to make a cheesy looking made-for-TV movie.  But combined together, they have the opposite effect.The excessive amounts of digital post processing for lighting, combined together with the excessive cartoonish fast forwarded camera movements, are what most make the movie look CHEESY and poorly crafted, despite all the high tech 48fps and outstanding motion capture and other high level attention to detail and special effects.It is little wonder that some of the best parts of the movie are where the camera director and post processing digital editor were throttled,  leaving us with fairly still, or simple slowly panning/soaring movements, as well a natural lighting.  It is in these scenes that all the beautiful visuals of this movie get their chance to shine through and take hold in our brains and allow us to immerse ourselves back into the world of Middle Earth.",1355529600,"12 15, 2012"

"I watched this movie recently with several family members and must say that considering the subject matter it left us feeling flat. The storyline is predictable, especially if you know the history of ""El Jefe"" or the story of the sisters and the mariposas(butterflies). Many people here at Amazon have done a good job of describing(beware of spoilers)the movie so I'll skip that part in this review. The story lines adapted from the book are weak, the characters only somewhat believeable but overall it is a shallow depiction of the ruthless regime of Trujillo. The black and white photographas in the beginning lend credibility to the story, are quite graphic, as are the torture scenes but otherwise the movie is luke warm; the action or suspense never heats up. Edward Olmos is good as Trujillo but there is not enough of him. His character seems almost benevolent, the father-like figure of the country who rules with a firm but gentle hand. If we could have seen more of his anger,his suspicion of others, his ruthless and vile conduct it would have been more interesting. Selma Hayek was very good and pretty much dominated the film. I agree with the another reviewer that more attention should have been given to the collective body of work of the sisters. Essentially this is one of those movies you might want to only rent rather than buy. There just isn't enough there to spend your money on. Recommended for movie buffs who like a little history based on a book that does a much better job of telling a story.",1197417600,"12 12, 2007"
"I was prepared to dislike this movie from the start. A rom-com set in Afghanistan. The first half of the film was charming-reminded me a little of Mel Brooks-""The Producers"".(Does Springtime for Hitler and Germany"" )ring a bell?To the midpoint it was pretty good-,and was winning me over. Unfortunately the ""comedian"" becomes a dominant character-and his Bhorat offensiveness is a matter of ones personal taste,or lack thereof.There's a twist at the end of the movie that tries to tie together the various plot lines. It fails-leaving this movie very close to being a right wing screed about Muslims.Meh-There's a comedy set in Iraq called ""Saving Private Perez"" which is genuinely amusing,playing on many stereotypes,but the humor is superior. The acting better. The script better,etc etc  see : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461336/If you are paying to see  Zero Dark Dirty,your bucks are better spent seeing ""Saving Private Perez"". Satire doesn't have to be hateful-unless Howard Stern and Bhorat are your heroes.Zero Dark Dirty is better than ""zero"" but it fails to be better than low average.

"In 2002, the romantic comedy ""Maid in Manhattan"" was a box office success.  #1 in the box office and earning over a $154 million worldwide.The film was directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"", ""Last Holiday"", ""The Center of the World"") and a screenplay by Kevin Wade (""Meet Joe Black"", ""Working Girl"", ""Mr. Baseball"").  The film would feature cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub (""Georgia Rule"", ""Ninja Assasin"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"") and music by Alan Silvestri (""Beowulf"", ""Night at the Museum"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" and ""The Mummy"" films).VIDEO:""Maid in Manhattan"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  Having seen this film several times on DVD, I can tell you that the film looks vibrant on Blu-ray.  The New York City skyline looks absolutely beautiful in the background and with many colors throughout the film, once again Sony Pictures Home Entertainment does a great job with the transfer.  Skin tones are natural and Jennifer Lopez looks absolute beautiful.  Detail is much more evident during the hotel sequences but it's the scenes when they are outdoor and you see New York City, which I found to be beautiful.  It definitely caught my attention when I saw it on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Also, catching my attention this time around is the lossless audio.  The film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Thai and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Although the film is dialogue driven and audio is primarily front and center channel, I felt the music was really lively this time around.  Simon and Garfunkel's ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" sounded pristine in lossless.  As for surround channel, there was not much being used (or was there a need for it) but did notice certain crowd scenes (primarily when Ty was giving his speech) and the reverb from the mic of the host of the speech night being heard through the surround channels.But for the most part, the lossless audio is satisfactory for this type of film.  Again, I found the lossless audio much more apparent now than I have ever experienced watching this film prior on DVD.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified).SPECIAL FEATURES:""Maid in Manhattan"" comes with a single special feature in standard definition and in English stereo with Spanish, Chinese, Thai and Portuguese subtitles.  * Blooper Reel - (7:31) Bloopers from ""Maid in Manhattan""  * Trailers - Upcoming or available films on Blu-ray from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.JUDGMENT CALL:""Maid in Manhattan""is a delightful romantic comedy.  It's also my favorite film to feature Jennifer Lopez, who had come a long way since her appearance on ""Selena"" and ""Anaconda"".  But most importantly, I felt that the film was good timing at the theaters.  I remember watching this film (which went up against another romantic comedy ""Two Weeks Notice"" with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and also shot in NYC) a year after 9/11 and thinking how beautiful New York City looked and how appropriate it was to bring the NYC romantic comedy back on the big screen.I enjoyed the film for its lightheartedness and although not necessarily complex, just a fun romantic comedy to sit back, watch and enjoy.  Although, in a sense it is a fairytale romantic comedy along the same vein as ""Pretty Woman"", where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere had magnificent chemistry, although Lopez and Fiennes worked well together, I felt that the two didn't have the same type of magic.Overall, ""Maid in Manhattan"" is a simple but fun romantic comedy and for those who enjoyed the film on DVD, the beautiful visuals of the New York City skyline and hearing that Simon and Garfunkel music, all so clearly in lossless audio may be enough for you to upgrade.  The original DVD was a bit lackluster in special features, so at least people can see the blooper reel included.  It would have been nice to have an audio commentary or featurette to be included but at least there is something and it's not another barebones release.If you are looking for a romantic comedy film just in time for Valentines Day or just a big fan of the film or J.Lo, then ""Maid in Manhattan"" is definitely worth picking up on Blu-ray!",1267488000,"03 2, 2010"
"A movie that must surely carry the record for the longest, most protracted, most drawn out death scene committed to film....EVER!From the very beginning right down to an extremely over-long final rendition of ""Bye Bye Love"" (I think I'm gonna die!) you will undoubtedly be begging for the privilege of turning off Roy Scheider's life-support system just to put him out of YOUR misery!Directed by Bob Fosse, (and supposedly semi-autobiographical), this whole piece is literally nothing but a framework for the insertion of multiple dance routines, all bearing those unmistakable moves associated with Fosse, but having so little to do with anything else.Several of these are quite clumsily incorporated, bearing little on the supposed story, and not advancing the narrative...(such as it is), at all.It's just a long, long increasingly depressing ever downward spiral of self-destruction by the lead man.If Scheider didn't already have lung cancer before, he most certainly would have after making this movie. He is never without a cigarette dangling from his lips, and only puts one out to light another!You could be in danger from passive smoke just watching!That, along with the constant ingestion of Dexedrine and bottles of booze.......and you can see where this is going long, long before it gets there, ...and the journey is not all that engrossing.And all for what?So ""the show must go on"" of course!Now just exactly why this must be is of course never explained.The world probably won't end if some Broadway show doesn't open......From time to time the movie attempts to get all metaphysical, with Scheider's character talking to ""The Angel of Death""....here played by Jessica Lang in various over-the-top white outfits, who really should have done her assigned job so MUCH sooner and put us all out of our misery.Obviously made in the same genre as ""A Chorus Line"" and all those other Broadway musicals about Broadway musicals featuring casts of dancers in sweaty lycra, Fosse's efforts now come across as monumental self-indulgence. The moves have become so familiar and so clich as to almost constitute parody in our minds. The ""jazz hands"", the top hats, the lifted knee, the angular contortions, .....even ""Cabaret"" gets a reprise here complete with bentwood chair.Then there's that odd sequence that is supposed to be ""sexy"", where all the dancers strip down to very little and writhe about in male/male, woman/woman and male/female pairs.... trying to sex up a tedious song about air-travel, but although performed well by the cast, it just doesn't fit comfortably into the movie at all,, and again you suspect it was just something Fosse wanted to choreograph, then had to find a place to insert it.In a nutshell, the movie is just WAY too long, and there's not enough rapport with any of the characters, or the lead man in particular to hold your interest, or make you care whether he dies or not.In fact he's SO un-engaging that you just want him to hurry up and get it over with. Dammit, go towards the light already!As mentioned before, the last ""big number"" is so prolonged by repetition that you will be tempted to reach for the fast forward button.Scheider tries valiantly, but he's not given much material to work with , and he's also burdened by a bizarre wig that changes back and forth between blond and dark. This is no ""Jaws"" for him that's for sure!VERY dated, and strictly for lovers of archival Fosse dance moves now.The story?Broadway director overworks and drinks/drugs himself to death. That's it...interspersed with those Bob Fosse production numbers. Performed in dance rehearsal gear of course!The longest suicide  ever!",1489968000,"03 20, 2017"

I'm sure officially there was a ""schedule conflict"", but I can't help but wonder if this is why the original actress wasn't on board.  Either way, it was nice to see George's story continue a bit further, but I thought it left a lot to be desired (Mandy Patinkin not excluded).

"In all honesty, I never thought Larry Cohen's original shlock fest It's Alive was anything special in the first place, and to no surprise, this direct-to-DVD remake isn't either.  This time around, Bijou Philips and James Murray play the parents of the murderous, blood-hungry little tyke, who isn't quite as mutant-looking he was in the original film.  That being said, there really isn't too much in the way of explanation as to much of what goes on in It's Alive, as we witness some people doing some very stupid things, and some non-sensical moments within the plot that are nothing short of head scratching.

Basically, this film is made and written like that of a comic book,but a very badly written one. My dislike for this film isn't because of the gratuitous violence,the poorly written script and dialog,piss poor acting,the over use of the ""F""bomb, the poorly produced CG, or its plot/contents. Pretty much, this film sucks virtually from begining to end...its all bad. Its not because this film is tasteless,the writers and director just demonstrait the lack of effort put into the writing,scenes and dialog. It could have been a great deal better. You can't really pin point anything specific,its the film in its entirety that suffers and makes all the actors look like clowns. Its a badly written script based on a decent/interesting idea. Even in the featurette the writers admitted that this film was based on a ""rough draft"".How pathetic. Also to note, it appears that Nicolas Cage's personal life is also affecting his decision making concerning his film projects. He is still a great actor(I.M.O)with a great deal more to give and offer given the right material. I only hope he cleans his personal life up and in turn...makes better choices in his future film career. So pretty much what you have here is an obnoxious film with lots of swearing,stupid cartoon action/violence with lots of T&A and some soft porn. With some fine tuning, this could have been a really fun film,but alas...the public these days are easy to entertain and sometimes the medicore wins in a land slide. The only way i could think of enjoying this film would not being sober. I'm glad I never paid to see this in the theater and only slightly disapointed I wasted the $4.25 and 1 1/2 hours of my life renting it to watch at home.

"If you loved Braveheart, then you must buy this dvd.  It rivals Mel Gibson's movie with a story just as serious and loving as the other.  Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast give performances that are believeable and fun to watch.  Especially Joaquin Phoenix, who's only other film was Return to Paradise.  I enjoyed watching him be so evil.  The movie was fluid and didn't really seem to last that long even though it is 2 hours and 35 minutes long.  Director Ridley Scott adds his touch with exquisite dream sequences and breath-taking scenery.  Along with slow motion fight sequences where you can really see the brutality of war.

"i bought this dvd set at a huge discount.  i remember the series was out years ago and never followed it.  and i got to say, what a mess.  although based on a graphic novel, or comic, it seems like oliver stone's answer to Twin Peaks that finished up earlier.  stone was clearly trying to imitate Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and bombed in so doing.  i'm amazed at how many positive reviews this has.  none of the actors were strong, the music was over dramatic, using everything from Bethoven's 7th to the Animals and Rolling Stones.  angie dickinson as a thug?  come on! it was embarrassing to watch her: gouge someone's eyes out, bitch slap and gut punch another.  cattrell was equally miscaste and her dramatic cry of ""it's my baby!""  was laughable.  in trying to be bizarre, it failed miserably.  there isn't any level that i would recommend this series.  buy it used if you must waste your money.",1237766400,"03 23, 2009"
"Coincidentally I rented ""Wavelength"" and I purchased ""Six-String Samurai"" during the same week. Both movies featured lots of scenery from Death Valley and surrounding areas. While ""Wavelength"" emphasized Panamint Valley, ""Six-String Samurai"" contained many scenes that were filmed in Searles Valley. Both valleys are near Death Valley. Another interesting coincidence is that both movies feature somewhat unusual soundtracks. The soundtrack for ""Wavelength"" was created by Tangerine Dream and ""Six-String Samurai"" featured lots of surf guitar songs. I'll admit that I wasn't crazy about either soundtrack, but atleast they weren't normal, boring, typical soundtracks either. Both movies were a little quirky and both seemed to have low budgets, or atleast not the greatest production quality. On the otherhand, both movies were interesting to watch and somewhat enjoyable, but I'm not sure if I would have found them so interesting if I wasn't preoccupied with identifying the locations where various scenes were shot. So, if you enjoy interesting desert scenery, I'd recommend both movies. The last third of ""Wavelength"" featured lots of scenes shot in Panamint Valley and the other movie had nice shots of the Trona Pinnacles. From a plot and character perspective, I'd say that ""Wavelength"" was the better of the two movies although the first two-thirds of the movie was a little tedious (they should have gotten to the desert a little sooner in the movie).",1152230400,"07 7, 2006"
"First off, anybody purchasing this film expecting a Peter Sellers vehicle will be slightly disappointed.  This is an ensemble piece with Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as the nominal stars.  Sellers has a smallish role as an ancient projectionist.  That said, this is a movie that champions the movie-going experience even if you experience it at a fleabag establishment and the viewing fare are old cornball cowboy movies whose prints are scratched, faded, and out of focus.  Since this movie came out in the fifties, I can relate this experience to my own youth viewing genre movies (kung-fu, slasher,etc.) at soon to be demolished downtown Philadelphia movie palaces in the late seventies and early eighties.

"If this list had been made when Hogan was on good terms and still active in the WWE, he would have easily been 1 or 2. Same with Flair. It's a travesty to put such big names ranked so low and then turn around have guys like Edge, Cena, Race, Steamboat, Piper, Mysterio, Guerrero, Savage(RIP), Triple H, Perfect,  and  Dusty Rhodes all ahead of Hogan. Most of these guys wouldn't, in all honesty, put themselves ahead of Hogan. Especially the younger guys. Race, Steamboat and Rhodes were great, but they were never at the level of Hogan. They were active when he was but they didn't tranform the business the way he did. Same with Piper. His best attribute was his mouth. Nothing more. Perfect was great and should have been given the WWE belt at least once but never did. Piper maybe too but Vince didn't do so. I guess this is his way of paying them back.Like I said, if this were made 5 or 10 years ago, no question, Hogan or Flair would have been at the one spot. I could even live with top 5 due to Michaels and Undertaker being so great. They are constants of the WWE the last 20 years and deserve to be near the top, but neither of those guys were game changers like Hogan, regardless of anything he may or may not have done behind the scenes.

"Takami Fujiwara doesn't know why his best friends Iggy and Cole are always making such a big deal out of racing down Mt. Akina all the time like it's some ultimate accomplishment in their lives. Cole even has a ""pro"" team called the ""Speed Stars"" which owns the bragging rights for fastest times down the mountain. Little do they know that Tak's father was a great racer in his own time and has taught Tak everything he knew. Not for racing, but to deliver tofu for his business! Iggy and Cole talk Tak into getting a job with them to save up money to buy an ""Eight Six"", a legendary racing car. Imagine their shock when they find out that the car Tak has been delivering tofu in IS an ""Eight Six"" but he was so ignorant of automobiles he didn't even know what it was! Another racing team, the ""Red Suns"", arrives on the scene to conquer the Speed Stars, and even Cole might not be able to beat them. But there is a car, like a ghost in the night, that defeated one of the Red Suns....that just happens to have been an Eight-Six! Will Tak reveal his skills to his friends to keep Mt. Akina under Speed Star territory or not?Initial D looks so bad visually that any good points it has are undercut. The character designs look awful with everybody's head looking like swollen bananas and their lips looking like dead butterflys. It almost felt like I was watching the Simpsons! But I can't fault the anime creators because the manga looks just as bad and looks like a fan comic that somehow caught on with the teenage set during the street racing craze. So this sketchy and unfinished look was translated to the anime. What's funny is that in the middle of these awful looking characters are these CG cars that stand out in huge contrast to the crudeness of the animation around them and look like rhinoceri sliding across ice. The shaky edit cuts where the picture literally jumps doesn't increase my respect for the show either. It was mildly entertaining, but to me, for a racing anime, there wasn't a lot of racing, just a lot of talking by faces that would look at home on the Munsters.

"Couples Retreat could have been much funnier, but turns out to be a wannabe of the old Fantasy Island TV Series.  One of the lines the welcomes spouts when the couples arrive at ""Eden West"" -was we need no money here - only smiles (gag).  There were no smiles nor laughs during the movie, just a wild hope throughout that something crazy, zany would happen - It didn't.  The humor was lost.Vince Vaughn was the strongest character, and yet he could not pull humor out of this bland comedy.  The cast was topnotch - Malin Akerman, Kristin Davis, Jason Bateman, Jon Favreau, Kristen Bell and Faizon Love but the script did no one justice.  Eden is the tropical island resort that helps couples work out problems in the marriage.  One couple had decided to divorce due to problems conceiving, but this trip was a last chance to make their marriage work.  The other three couples enabled all to go half price, but they did not want counseling - they were there to play, to enjoy the sun and jet ski.Counseling  is mandatory at 6 a.m as a group and then individual couples counseling sessions as well.  A satire of psycho-therapists that cause problems or complicate the couples lives ensues - whether steam baths with snow, snorkeling, yoga, New Age philosophy, or Asian teachings.  It becomes too much for all of them, and nothing is helping.  Soon they all end up on ""Eden East"" - the singles side of the island.  For some odd reason they all realize what marriage means from that vacuous adventure.If Lucy and Desi Arnez were alive today, they could have made Couples Retreat a hilarious laugh riot.  Instead we get very rare funny moments and a bland moral lesson.",1267833600,"03 6, 2010"

"First and foremost, this movie is atrocious.  Some of it feels like a really bad after school special with a bad budget.  Other aspects reminded me of the kind of R-Rated soap opera that gets cancelled after one episode.Essentially it's a movie about a school infected and overrun by zombies.  Some girls have sores on their sweater kittens.  One girl has a completely idiotic history of abuse and flute music hypnotism.  Along with the abused, the only girls immune to the infection are those on the swim team, because of the pool's chemicals.  A fight for survival and the school ensues (as if the zombies stood a chance against a girl with a crotch-laser).The highlights, if they can be called that, are all about exploitation and absolutely horrible production value.  It's the side-melon shot, the up-skirt, the unnecessary shower scene, faux-lesbianism, and the voyeuristic close-ups of butt cheeks that peek outside of tight panties underneath schoolgirl outfits (when they're not in swimsuits).  The exploitation factor is through the roof in this one, and it there is no doubt that those who made this are the same crowd who have fueled the most bizarre videos that have come out of Japan (you know which ones I'm talking about).  As for the production value, it may be the worst in any movie I've ever seen.  The acting is atrocious in any language.  The gore is so hokey that it's insulting.  Everything else is pathetic.Aside from the zombie teacher who juggles rulers and uses them like kitanas, and the female teacher who speaks in hilarious Engrish (both are unintentionally funny), the only thing this movie has going for it is naked Japanese chicks engaging in gratuitous soft-core action (which is probably why most people watch this in the first place).",1245715200,"06 23, 2009"

But I found it impossible to believe this woman was the most beautiful woman in the world, whose appearance so bewitched and fascinated men that they would kill and die for her. The actress cast as Helen is certainly pretty, but in a rather waif-like and generic ""Vogue"" way that is certainly not representative of classical ideals of beauty in any way. Helen should not be merely ""pretty"", like most modern magazine models are, but her beauty should be more unusual and striking. For a perfect example of this kind of beauty, I refer you to Leelee Sobieski as the nymph Deianeira in the 2005 TV version of ""Hercules"". Now that's a Helen.",1158710400,"09 20, 2006"

"By browsing at SNAFU-II chances are you're already familiar at some point with the first season, which is good because this season is not very forgiving with new comers. Most of its story lines were over dramatic, opposed to our uncaring human attitudes. Yet, without this drama like 90-99% of SNAFU-II (and most other media production) could not be created.So, everything follows season 1, and we get what we had to expect first from the main character, Hachiman Hikigaya (Hiki) who faces the consequences from his last verbal fight with Minami, a girl from the cliques that always discriminated him. The show made some think that Hiki did it out of his typical trait of self-sacrifice to help others, a Japanese stereotype. Another interpretation is that what he did was getting the grudge out of his chest while lying to himself, a typical real human action. Anyways, his snap made him look like a horrible person for most people around. Many people may feel familiar with the situation. Solutions? SNAFU-II is about Hiki's solutions!The animation art improved while Hiki mellowed on his antisocial behaviors, but don't expect too much though! The others didn't mellow very much their own either. Yukino Yukinoshita -2nd lead character- will get quite testing at times. Some people superficially complained from the 1st season that at the end he (and nobody else for that matter) never changed, which is real life! Nobody changes personality quickly and most of us never change much for real, just what happened here; thats what the SNAFU initials stand for (explicit). And SNAFU for all its limitations- is still about reality.Reality can only be figured out by meditation, deep thought or philosophy, which carries the risk of losing itself, which is what Hiki may fall for at the end, without losing himself. I even doubted the shows translation accuracy (from another source), but Hiki was already on this path.  It must be stated that the plots got more complex and exciting in this season. Remember delirious-chubby Yoshiteru Zaimokuza? Hes back and becomes Hikis right arm on a plot to take on the student council!So, Hiki is finally changing and improving his relations with his school peers, which implies and awesome display of forgiveness, especially to Yumiko, maybe the nastiest person in season 1 and still some here. Perhaps Hiki over-did his healing by turning himself in a sort of cupid, spy or some other servant position, which also happen quite often in real life, moving between extremes.SNAFU-II gave excessive attention to Hayato, the popular guy and presented communication problems too hard to believe, but who knows. Human communication is in fact a hard skill, the very gist of these series. It was great when the show displayed the typical debacle of todays middle-class meetings wasted in hollow-wordy speech, sometimes plain pretentiousness, either at work, school, church, etc.So our time-wasteful ways have spread even to Japan. BUT the final meeting here will show you a real lesson of leadership. Most bloggers praised both Hiki and Yukino for their confrontational ways that wouldve ruined any agreement and totally missed who was the real deal-maker: Yui Yuigahama, cheerful but clueless and incapable of speaking up. Yui did take Hiki and Yukinos stream but used it for gaining supporters to their cause to the point of making good use of useless jerks such as Kaori Orimoto. Yui was the real hero in the plot to organize the Christmas event.The one who didn't look much like a hero was Haruno, Yukinos older sister. Haruno, charismatic, rich, beautiful and revered, both in the show and by the audience, even though she caused serious trouble in the previous season by encouraging people to goof-off during the cultural festival. Then the workload piled on a few ones, like Hiki, who was not even supposed to complain. A situation not only Japanese but perfectly American as well. Well, Haruno finally start showing her true colors, ruins the mood in one event, goes on full preying on Yukino and getting their mom involved, which made SNAFU-II become one of the few anime shows displaying a scene of parental sexual repression. Yukino will finally start showing a feeling for Hiki, but the ever-present sexual-repression of most anime heroes should only distress Yukino, never her mom.SNAFU-II probably gave too much space to a new cute, lively and cunning girl, Iroha Isshiki, the one on the cover between the main trio. But it was a great example of the typical female assumption that we men- are always after women, especially pretty ones. Yet, Iroha did make the show more entertaining.If you're rightly tired that what the best regular media-entertainment approach to reality is trash like duck dynasty and other reality shows do something and support-buy products like SNAFU-II.",1473984000,"09 16, 2016"

It's still a decent film that's strengthened by its fight content, but a bit too far from perfect to warrant a purchase for me.The story: The family of a war veteran (Le) is murdered by a racist underground faction after he interferes with their business, prompting him to target the group and its leader (Dolph Lundgren) for retribution.I don't blame the stars or even the director (Giorgio Serafini,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Death/dp/B004F7BGBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Death</a>) for the movie's ""DTV-isms."" The production company behind the film, Voltage Pictures, has a habit of editing its low budget movies in amateurish ways, so expect to see lots of gratuitous slow motion and sped-up segments, ""artistic"" lighting overexposures, unnecessary close-ups, and scene-hopping.  These aspects are present just enough to properly irritate you but not ruin the movie, to the same degree that the screenplay bothers me. There's a good deal of unnecessary cruelty and exploitation of women that I don't appreciate, and I find it hard to forgive how boring the script renders Dolph Lundgren. The Swedish Superman excels at playing villains,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/even-in-DTV-movies/dp/B0085Z3ABI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">even in DTV movies</a>, and though it seems like the part of the long-haired supremacist leader would let him show off some of his creepiness, he clearly doesn't have good character material to work with and ends up being pretty unmemorable.Cung Le shows his rather meager dramatic limits, though he still makes a good tough guy. Another tough guy, Vinnie Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-The-Last-Stand/dp/B000HCO83Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: The Last Stand</a>), plays a character that weirdly has the bare minimum to do with the plot but manages through sheer charisma to still come off cool. But actions speak louder than words in these kinds of movies, and this is where ""Puncture Wounds"" shows its best side. With only four fight scenes and one shootout, the movie could definitely use more action, though Cung Le's kicks are worth waiting for. The choreography manages to appear completely efficient without shirking flashiness, so it's very satisfying when Le takes on groups of bad guys. His finale with Lundgren is much shorter than it should be, but it allows Lundgren to look pretty fluid and powerful, using his height, reach, and power karate to take the fight to Le, cool but believably.The fights too are hampered by the aforementioned editing, so despite being the movie's brightest spot, they can't elevate this review to a higher rating. Despite this one being a minor disappointment, I'm hopeful for Le's future, provided he choose a better studio for his next vehicle. I hope Lundgren used this flick as a warm-up to his impending films with Tony Jaa, but that's another matter. Bottom line: if you're looking for an imperfect but moderately exciting karate-revenge movie, this one fits the bill well enough, but it's not nearly the best any of its performers have to offer.",1401235200,"05 28, 2014"

"I can understand why a sequel was made to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.The sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go ""Ohhhhh!!""?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!Another problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.One more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?Viewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).Chalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of ""Scream.""  While ""Scream"" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.",1065657600,"10 9, 2003"
"This movie has no ending.  The narrative as it's established suddenly takes a left turn at the end.  But I guess we're supposed to like this because the critics said so or that it won Best Picture.

Faithful to the original material...and dumb.  I prefer stories to be complete.  I don't care if ending is happy or not but this sort of 'originality' is pointless--like the documentary Leviathan.

"This movie illustrates that not only is Quentin Tarantino talented and imaginative but he is also perversely obsessed with the depiction of gruesome levels of violence.  Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence ends up spoiling what could be otherwise some brilliant scene making, and some memorable characters.  Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant and hypnotizing as a garrulous and smoothly sociopathic SS officer.  Brad Pitt plays a Tennessee rube turned Nazi Hunter.  There are memorable performances by other actors and actresses, but the level of graphic violence, much of which is unnecessary to the plot, suggests that Quentin Tarantino, for whatever undeniable talents he may have, is a disturbed man.  I probably should have been forewarned by some of his previous equally gruesome productions where violence takes center stage.  For people who don't want to watch people's brains being bashed in, or people being literally scalped in front of them, this is for sure a movie to avoid.  The director and producer needs lots of psychotherapy.",1264809600,"01 30, 2010"

"To me the Coen brothers movies are hit or miss.  Fargo is one of my all time favorite movies & Burn after Reading looks good.  But The Ladykillers, O Brother where art thou and this.......?  Fair play to them for making movies that they like - and rejecting criticism of the ending of this movie (see below) - and not pandering to Hollywood.......but by the same token if you're looking for Hollywood, stay clear.This just didn't click for me.  Josh Brolin was good, I could believe in him.  Tommy Lee Jones was mostly good.  I find him a one dimensional actor really so I wasn't that impressed.  Woody Harrelson & Javier Bardem for me just didn't cut it.  They were supposed to be bad guys but I just found them funny.  Honestly, at times I couldn't tell if Bardem was playing it for laughs (was that the point?)However the single biggest problem is the ending.  It's awful.  It's just like the Coen's got bored or thought ""oh, we've only got 5 minutes to rap this up"".Truly disappointing.

"IDES OF MARCH directed by and starring George Clooney is so current and hot it almost blisters the home video screen.  If you're still nave about the nature of politics and politicians, perhaps it's time to see the cynical truth; things are much the same as it was between Caesar and Brutus.  But when I hear the hypocritical, self-serving remarks of potential candidates for a Presidential nomination, Clooney's movie seems suddenly tame and reserved.  Ryan Gosling is terrific as an idealistic political advisor whose eyes have been opened to the ease of selling one's soul to gain power -- and perhaps revenge.  The great cast includes: Evan Rachel Wood, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei and Paul Giamatti.",1327276800,"01 23, 2012"
"I think ABC missed a golden opportunity not packaging the Final Season in a white box and a black box, offering the season through the perspectives of Jacob and the Man in Black respectively.  After all, this was the duality set up six years ago when Locke was showing Walt how to play backgammon, giving him a little lesson on Manichaeism by holding up black and white game pieces.  Odd, that throughout this long and troubling final season, Cuselof made no reference back to this memorable scene.The season certainly offered a promising start.  The opening double episode was packed with thrills and intrigues that carried over into two or three more episodes, but as Cuselof tried to give us ""deeper"" insights into the island, the action all but came to a halt and we seemed to digress into a quasi-Biblical view of the island culminating in the Ballad of Jacob and His Brother, which presented us with the origins of the ""game"" they played between them, and the Man in Black's long suppressed desire to get off the island.Cuselof toyed with us a little with another band of castaways led by Dogen, who guarded the Temple from the evil that has come to possess Locke.  We also get treated to an alternative reality set in LA where the Lostaways seemed to be looking for their individual redemption.  No mention of Dharma, and Ben seems reduced to a shadow of his former self.  Despite the new cast members, the return of Widmore, and the interesting ""sideways"" episodes, this show returns to the core members from Season One, with the Jacob/MIB story woven into the early episodes through flashbacks.Unfortunately, it isn't very satisfying, as the writers choose to leave much of the island history they developed over five seasons in the crater left by the explosion at the Swan station at the end of Season Five, and take us on a more spiritual journey that loses most of the tension set up in the initial episodes.  But, feeling they may have gotten too sentimental, they jolted us back into the here and now with an island-shaking final episode that attempted to resolve the dual realities they set up.You will either love or hate this final season, as it is quite a departure from the previous seasons. I think a little more thought needs to be given to its packaging, and throwing in some extras that help explain some of the creative process behind this show would be in order. At the very least, they should include the ""Lost Untangled"" web series with Puppet Chang, as it was a lot of fun, and showed that the writers could at least poke fun at themselves.",1274918400,"05 27, 2010"

The interviews with ""experts"" were a complete and total joke. Honestly, I started to wonder if they intended for this to be a comedy. I was okay with it until the end. That was unrealistic and sensationalized and although it was foreshadowed earlier in the movie, I still found it the most unbelievable part of the story. Obviously, despite the ""based on a true story"" statement at the beginning, if you watch ALL the way to the end, you will see the ""this is a work of fiction"" disclaimer. And if you look up the name ""Meagan Mullen"" you only find it in relation to this movie. So no, not based on a true story. And that's a good thing, because if the brother was anything like the way he is characterized in this movie, I would have wished that he had died instead of the person who did.

"When we think about Spielberg, we are aware about yarns, and we tend to assume the ride as cantral part of the show. There have been many copycast but this is probably the most original among the countless scripts that pretend to follow the Spielberg's pattern.Let's be sincere. The film begins with a breathtaking and unstoppable display of energy. There are many historical aspects in game and the search of this treasure was a guarantee to make us experience a major doses of histamine and creativeness.But the plot pitifully shifted to commonplaces. Good guys and bad guys. A beautiful girl involved and a web of tied events. But since the document is stolen, it would seem the plot deflated.Car chases, expected situations to conclude into a scene that doesn't generate major enthusiasm.I must admit the cast is impressive.

"George Lucas will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the men who changed the face of entertainment. Star Wars was, in essence, the single factor which moved science fiction and fantasy from the back room, marginalized treatment they had been accustomed to and put them into the spotlight. There is no other single show or book I can recall in my lifetime which has had nearly so much influence. Unfortunately, that puts him on the spot when it comes to following up on his own material; it's expected that he at least tries to match his original's success. Monetarily, he's managed to pull it off. In terms of how good the movie is... no. The original Star Wars was a slam-bang fun action adventure film, a tribute to the old serials and a nod to other inspirations as diverse as Kurusowa's Hidden Fortress and Doc Smith's Lensman series. (the Campbellian babble that followed wasn't part of the original design -- Lucas just wisely took that thread and ran with it). The FUN derived not just from the action, but from the basic themes of good versus evil, and good triumphant over evil. The Empire Strikes Back had to  back off, of necessity, from the latter, but Return of the Jedi gave it back in spades. Then came The Phantom Menace. Lucas' first mistake was doing a prequel. True, there were books that dealt with the later years, but he'd always stated they weren't canon and wasn't restricted to them. And if he liked them, he could have just filmed Tim Zahn's trilogy. Instead, he gives us a prequel that focuses on Anakin Skywalker -- the Boy Who Would Be Vader -- and begins the fall of the Republic. Other egregious mistakes -- the words ""midichlorian"" and ""Jar Jar"" became curse-words for Star Wars fans -- made TPM a horrid experience. To its credit, Attack of the Clones avoids the worst mistakes of its immediate predecessor and offers us a few worthwhile moments (most viewers agree that watching Yoda jump around like a demented superball on crack is worth a large chunk of the admission fee). However, it can NEVER -- nor can its successor -- give audiences the real Good Triumphs Over Evil feeling, because WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S COMING. Anakin can't see that he's making a mistake, or at least won't acknowledge it. Obi-Wan can't save him. Palpatine won't get his butt whipped. Nor can it make up for this by providing us with better, more impressive substance. It's filled with logical holes, clumsy plot devices, and incredibly stupid characters who cause their own problems. The only REAL way to make sense of a lot of it is to assume the opposite of what we're being told -- that Yoda is one of the bad guys (or at least an exceedingly Machiavellian good guy), for instance, and that Anakin is using Jedi Mind Tricks on Amidala. So... it gets three stars. One for the Lucas that was, one for a few neat twists, and one for kickass action sequences. The two stars it could have gotten for actually being a good movie, or even a great movie, alas, are not to be. Nor, I fear, will they be available for the third movie. Lucas no longer has the people that helped him transform his ideas into brilliance (he did not really write the first three movies) and is reduced to pomposity, banality, and predictability.",1025395200,"06 30, 2002"

Although she is from New York, she has this midwestern girl-next-door sweetheart quality about her that SO intoxicates me.Now on to the movie.  The bad news is, it does not rank above ""OK.""  Although predictable, the plot was very contrived and beyond the realm of the believable.  The ending looked like it was edited with a chain saw.  Instead of coming to an end, the movie more-or-less just kind of ""stops.""The good news is that Helen Slater stars in the film!  (Did I mention that yet, perchance?).  Also, the rest of the actors are pretty good too, including Kelly Lebrock.  The fact that Helen appears topless in the film becomes one of its biggest selling points.This is not a great movie, by any stretch of the imagination.  It is basically a B movie that stars some actors who have been in A movies in the past.  For Helen Slater fans (like me!), however, the film is a must-have.  End of story.",1130025600,"10 23, 2005"

"Body by Bellydance is a fantastic follow up to Michelle's first workout dvd, Perfect Hips! This dvd not only provides a terrific workout for ""problem areas"", it also reinforces the basics of bellydance that she introduced us to on its worthy predecessor.Body by Bellydance is not another one of those intimidating, ""why did I even try this?"" workout dvds that will end up gathering dust on a shelf or being donated to a thrift shop. It is a truly enjoyable, fun to do, belly dance based workout that will make you feel fit and, most of all, feminine. And, while this workout may be a little challenging in spots, even if you are completely out of shape you can always modify or skip certain moves until you are ready to tackle them.Again, Michelle's friendly, warm personality comes through in this production making the dvd even more fun to use. When I work with Michelle's dvds (and I have them all!), I feel like I am getting a one on one lesson with a friend who is there to gently encourage me to do my best. I will be forever grateful that Michelle never resorts to those aggravating phrases that you so often hear on fitness/workout dvds. I swear I will scream if I hear ""C'mon you can do it! Oh, wow, you're doing great"" from an instructor who can't even see me to know whether or not I'm doing great or I've passed out on the floor...Anyone who is more than bored with the standard fare of workout dvds on the market today will find Body by Bellydance a real breath of fresh air. Thanks once again Michelle for giving us another absolute, must have dvd for our bellydance (and fitness) collections!!!",1210377600,"05 10, 2008"

"Overall a pretty good action thriller with many similarities in style, story and mood to Day of the Jackal, just not quite as good. For me the best parts are the roughly first three-fourths of the film, dominated by Shaw and FBI colleagues who track down Keller and Dern. The last part of the film is a series of wild improbablilities and somewhat anti-climactic special effects, in other words very much along the lines of a James Bond movie. But one must admire the editing which is done for maximum impact and is quite effective. Solid work by principals but Fritz Weaver seems miscast as befuddled FBI agent. For me it just misses four stars, thus a strong three.",1419984000,"12 31, 2014"

"HAPPINESS IS...PEANUTS FRIENDS FOREVER pairs the tv special ""You're In Love, Charlie Brown"" with episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW.""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"" first aired on tv in 1967. It's the second-to-last day of the school year and Charlie Brown realizes he's in love with the Little Red-Haired Girl. He spends the next two days trying to get up the nerve to the speak to the girl and let her know how he feels. Meanwhile, Lucy keeps telling Schroeder how much she loves him. One of my favorite parts of the special is when Peppermint Patty (in her on-screen debut) agrees to help Chuck out meeting that special Someone. The conclusion of the scene is classic comedy at its best.Episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW includes five segments:""Kite-Eating Tree"" - Charlie Brown gets in a fight with the kite-eating tree and makes it cry. Charlie visits Lucy.""Sally"" - Snoopy steals Sally's report for school. So, she takes Snoopy to school with her.""Camp"" - Charlie Brown & Linus go to camp for the summer. Charlie Brown gets sent home because he's ""trouble"".""Lucy Loves Schroeder"" - Lucy gets upset with Schroeder.""Scared Snoopy"" - Snoopy goes to see Lucy after hearing noises at night that scare him. He can't pay his bill and Lucy confiscates his supper dish until his bill is paid.YOU'RE IN LOVE, CHARLIE BROWN is a great Peanuts episode. It's been released several times already, but it never grows old. The pairing with Episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW is a good match. This is a good DVD if you aren't a major Peanuts fan. However, for true Peanuts fans, the only reason to purchase this DVD is for the episode of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW which has never been released on DVD in the U.S. I wish Warner Brother would go ahead and release a complete set of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW instead of nickel & diming themout like this with previously released tv specials.",1330646400,"03 2, 2012"

The story is about a Nam veteran gas station guy who stalk his cheesy customer, break into their house, rape and kill them. Background, unknown. All we watch is how he did those action, including torture and sodomize, of couse in triple X style (what can you expect?).Story  : nothing specialActing : Oh No!!Adult content : You know XXX, don't you?Collectible : They said it's a classicRemake : regarding the idea, I prefer a thriller than a porn.

"Not as good as many have made it out to be. An excellent cast does not make up for lackluster writing. The first episode was great and despite a nonsensical conclusion the last couple episodes were good.What didn't work: It was 3 or 4 episodes longer than necessary. There is entirely too much time spent watching people staring into space ""grieving"". Almost nothing happens between episodes 2-5. I disliked almost everyone in the lovely town of Broadchurch and one of the few characters I liked died due to screwed up circumstances. I felt nothing for the grieving family, their acting was fine but the writing lacked something. The town seems to consist mostly of two faced suburban nut jobs.What I did like: I liked the characters played by Olivia Coleman and David Tennant. The fallout Ellie will have to deal with and Alec's backstory are far more interesting than the story explored here. Arthur Darvill was good but he didn't have much to do and I mostly referred to him as Rory, couldn't help it but hopefully he'll have more to do in the next installment. Coleman and Tennant were absolutely excellent and the only reasons I watched through the entire series, ten stars for them.I bought this because I caught it on sale and I really love David Tennant and I'm hoping the second series is better. And if you haven't heard, Fox has made their own version called Gracepoint. Ten part series with new plot twists, a new ending, an an American accent for David Tennant.

"Disney likes wizards; they've done a movie incarnation of wizards at least once a decade starting with the original Fantasia.  Going thru films such as Fantasia 2000, the Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Aladdin, we now have a non-animated addition to this genre.  Based very loosely of the original Mickey Mouse short in Fantasia, this movie is driven primarily by the good dialogue, witty comedy, and low-key but effective special effects.  The action scenes are many, but short.  The story itself is somewhat predictable with two overlapping romances, a rivalry, an evil witch, and a lurking army of the dead that needs to be kept dead.  The sum of the parts is what was to be expected in the summer of 2010; a big-name movie filled with big name stars and worth the two hours of escapism.",1297209600,"02 9, 2011"

"EDITED TO ABIDE BY AMAZON STANDARDS CONCERNING LANGUAGE AND INSULTSMany years ago, practically in another life, I learned how to deactivate infernal devices.  Back in the 1980s EOD training focused primarily on unexploded ordinance rather than IEDs, and the stuff the IRA and PLO was putting together back then was downright primitive in comparison to some of the newfangled stuff our guys are facing now.  To put this in perspective, when I was at AIT cellphones hadn't even been invented yet.Even back in primitive times, one of the most basic and fundamental rules you learn is to consider the MANY possible anti-handling devices you might encounter.  Often, even a simple mil-spec device such as a landmine could have several anti-handling devices in place, and with an IED it could get downright devious.  I'm not going to go into any detail here, but anti-handling devices are designed to kill anyone who discovers the device and attempts to render it safe.  Any entry-level Combat Engineer knows you're not supposed to lift, roll, jostle, or shake a suspect device without a complete and detailed inspection.  The genius in this film is dragging 50 pound shells out of the dirt by their wires and prying open the trunk of a car to expose the bomb inside.  In real life, bad guys use tamper resistant bombs.  Pull it out of the dirt?  BOOM.  Open a boobytrapped trunk, hood, or door?  BOOM.  Snip random wires?  Holy collapsing circuit!  BOOM.  These were the first things you learned 25 years ago!  Today, EOD school is three times as long and you are practically qualified for an electrical engineering degree when you are done.  This idiot would have washed out halfway through the first phase.  Risktaking is one thing, foolhardy bravado is another, but what this guy was doing guaranteed him a Darwin Award.  It is glaringly obvious that no-one with any actual EOD experience was used as a consultant for this film.Wanton stupidity abounds, and to make things worse it isn't even an entertaining movie.  Unlikeable undeveloped characters, idiotic subplots that go nowhere, and no sense of reality.  Oh, I loved the scene when they are working the Barnett 50 which is a precision sniper rifle and they're sighting it in like an artillery piece, cleaning blood off the rounds to prevent it from jamming, and completely forget that there is an entire belt of ammo in the turret gun . . . but I digress.  Apparently, no-one who actually fired a gun was used to consult on this film either.  Ending sucked too.  Altogether, this was a dismal failure as a war movie.  Of course, the soulless drones in Hollywood and the Press Corps all think it is movie of the year deserving of numerous high awards.  This movie made me want to vomit.  I want my two hours back, as well as the two bucks I spent on the rental fee.  Full of suck.",1304467200,"05 4, 2011"

There is no real analysis.  There is not even real interest in getting at the truth of this carefully composed, self-conscious artiste.

"The only good thing about this movie is Denzel Washington's acting which is always outstanding. But even he couldn't salvage a movie so cliche'd as to defy description. I can usually ignore gross errors in films or action liberties but this movie went way beyond what I could tolerate.If it were advertised as a pure entertainment/over the top action/adventure movie then I would have ignored its failures but not when it is supposed to be a reality based disaster movie. At the beginning of the movie, it says it is based on a true story! If this movie was really based on a true story then woe is us because our train system is being run by idiots.If you know nothing about trains, cars, trucks, diesel fuel, etc and can ignore some serious stupidity then you might like this movie. It definitely has a lot of action and tension. It would be a good movie for kids as there is nothing bad in the movie, no swearing, no sex, no violence and it has heroes, lots of action and bad guys.On the other hand, ignore the following if you don't want to know what happens in the movie although the outcome should be obvious.The fundamental problem is that the movie ignores the obvious and does so repeatedly. They initially try to catch the runaway with a pickup truck that can run on rails (no problem with that as it is a common railroad vehicle). But it fails. And nobody thinks to put one in front going same speed then slow down until the runaway catches up and transfer someone to the runaway?Instead they use a helicopter to attempt to land a person on the runaway train but it fails also, then they stop trying? If you've got a train with an extremely toxic load, wouldn't you try and try until you succeeded? The alternative is massive destruction and loss of life, yet in the movie they only tried once. And you don't need a railroad expert either so you could use almost anyone.However, they do put another train (two locomotives) in front but with only one person on board and which slows down to catch the runaway train but why didn't they try to have someone then go from that train to the runaway? But of course this train crashes and the operator gets killed. Then they won't switch the train onto a siding to derail it but instead use some gimmicky Derailer that of course doesn't work either. Then they have a single locomotive (operated by Washington and Pine) which amazingly is able to slow down the runaway (which has two locomotives)! The ""Incredible Plan to Stop the Train"" was nothing more than catching it, hooking up and using the single locomotive to slow it down. Guess what? It doesn't work. They do eventually manage to stop the runaway and amazingly it stops on a dime even though all the brakes for the other cars are disconnected?And toss in a train full of kids (got to have kids in danger to add to the excitement). And the money grubbing executives who only care about the dollar loss. And the government official who just happens to be there (nice coincidence) and who tells a 28 year railroad veteran how to stop the runaway. There were even more cliche's but I won't bother to detail them, this movie had so many it was ludicrous.",1297900800,"02 17, 2011"
"As many have said, Robin Williams, in his final performance, leaves us a truly wonderful, albeit painful gift. I put off watching this film for weeks, feeling all but certain it would be so dreadfully sad. The very versatile actor Williams gives us a glimpse into the life of a 60 year old closeted man. It is so obvious that he is screaming at the top of his lungs, please, whatever you do, don't wind up living this pathetic and false existence!!  Of course,as anyone who is living a life that is completely out of control, the sh== is going to hit the fan! It is was just inevitable, that the 2 lives were going to transverse at some point. The scene in the bank parking lot when the young man who Williams has created a secret relationship with, is there to extort $3200 dollars from Williams to get his supposed pimp to go easier on him, at least for the next 24 hours or so. Robin's characters life is on view for all to see, the bank employees and customers, are horrified at seeing the truth that this closeted man has fiercely protected. I think there is also an obvious factor that one cannot watch this film without thinking of the real life tragedy, that Williams found no other way out to his miseries, and took his own life. Robin was the absolutely perfect actor to play this part!  To me the closet has to be the saddest existence, the mostawful falsehood that can create nothing but agony, and lack of fulfillment. I was on a flight recently from Copenhagen to NYC, and encountered a young male flight attendant who was the opposite of the main character in this film. He was as proud as a peacock that he was gay, and if anybody didn't like it, too bad!  I indicated to him that I was gay too, and told him that I thought it was really great that he was being his authentic self, and he appreciated my words. The saddest individuals I have met in my life were terrified that somehow their ""dirty little secret"" of their sexuality was going to come to light. Their lives were going to come unraveled and then what were they going to do? Lying is always so much harder and far more stressful than telling the truth, and much more work! I'm not surprised this film did not do well at the box office, it is like being at the scene of a car accident where you can't bear to look, or turn away. It is so tormenting. I thought all the actors in this film were excellent. And for those of you who were hoping to see the more madcap side of Robin (Mrs. Doubtfire) in his final film , this was also Robin's gift, as someone on here wrote, he was  so understated, so completely opposite of the manic parts he has played. RIP Robin, this might be your best work of all!!",1493164800,"04 26, 2017"

The result, a dead person is making the calls because her body was abandoned in an old defunct hospital.

"The 1960 LAST WOMAN ON EARTH opens with what seems to be genuine footage of a cockfight--and this cheap-o Corman Quickie goes down hill from there, with a ho-hum story about two men and a marginally attractive woman who survive what seems to be the end of the world, only to find themselves stuck in a beautiful beach house in lush and lovely Pureto Rico.  After a while the men begin to argue over the woman.  The conclusion is abrupt and the movie doesn't so much end as it just stops.  Mercifully.This is one of those grade C- flicks that lured the gullible into the local drive-in via a lurid title and lurid poster and which was typically shown as one of two short features ... but even at a mere seventy minutes LAST WOMAN ON EARTH can't be short enough.

"This long awaited DVD is an incredible disappointment.  The major problem that makes this unwatchable is that somehow this movie has been stretched horizontally to fit a widescreen TV.  The result makes everything look distorted.  I don't know what the original aspect ratio was but this presentation is an abomination.  I tried running it on my computer software to manually adjust the picture dimensions. The film does appear to be wider than the standard screen size but not the ratio as presented on this DVD.And to top it off the print appears to be something of the VHS quality (i.e. poor) with color and resolution deficiences. There appears to be a gash in the screen as if the video was shot from a movie screen with a tear in the top middle.  The sound appears to have been mono that someone has doctored up by added fake stereo and reverb, then steering the dialog from side to side. Warning: Listening to this may cause sea sickness.Sony should be sued for selling this junk.  I probably will  be returning my copy. One thing for sure: if you are unable to manually adjust the aspect ratio with a computer, do not buy this.

"If I could remember who suggested I watch this film, I'd thank them publicly here. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is one of the funniest and most fascinating stories I have watched. Leave it to Billy Wilder and Agatha Christie to concoct a story that'd keep viewers on the edges of their seats.Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) is known as the 'champion of lost causes.' He's the barrister's barrister and the fox.  He's also just recovering from a heart attack. The old curmudgeon is also stuck with a nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster), who continously talks babytalk to him.""Just roll up your mouth, you talk too much. If I'd known how much you talk I'd never have come out of my coma,"" he tells her--and worse.Doctors have ordered Sir Wilfrid to rest, stop smoking, drinking, and only try civil suits. When he hears about the case where gigolo Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is accused of killing Emily Jane French a wealthy older woman, he cannot resist to try the case.Everything's going well til Christine Helm-Vole (Marlena Dietrich) takes the stand and unbeknowst to Sir Wilfred beforehand testifies for the prosecution.Can the old fox still get his client off?  This story has more twists than a pretzel factory. The dialog, particularly Sir Wilfrid's, is some of the best I have heard. The end literally had me up and out of my seat.My only reason for a half-star deduction is because the black and white rendering on the DVD is very dark and makes it occasionally difficult to view without doing some contrast adjustments.  Still, this film is very worth watching and I suspect I will want to see it again and again.",1199059200,"12 31, 2007"

"A documentary made by a filmmaker named Marti DiBergi ( played by Rob Reiner) gives a look into England's loudest heavy metal band called ""Spinal Tap"" on their history from 60's swingers to a rock sensation that has swept both America & England, there is interviews with the band members Nigel Tugnel ( Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins ( Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls ( Harry Shearer) and behind the scenes of their latest album ""Smell the Glove"".This entertaining and hilarious mockumentary on a fictional non-existent rock band has became a cult sensation and a midnight favorite. There is such originality within the script itself, a self-mocking sense of humor is what helps the comedy of this movie.Rob Reiner's direction is flawless, there is also appearences by Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal makes this one unforgettable cult comedy experience you must not miss.The special edition is just as great as the movie itself with awesome transfer & great sound quality, the extras are also very good such as audio commentary by Spinal Tap themselves, outtakes, music videos, 6 TV commericals, Trailers, a Fictional but funny Flower People Press Conference, Spinal Tap appearence on "" The Joe Franklin Show"" and "" Heavy Metal Memories"" fake commercial.This is totally one of the best comedies ever made, so if you love a good laugh & rock music at the same time, i suggest you own this movie and enjoy.",1103587200,"12 21, 2004"

"This was the typical movie where they give you despicable villains and then kill them off in what they hope will be a gratifying way. This formula works for so many people, most of the time. However, this movie didn't really work too hard to be realistic. It was actually more ""campy"" with bodies exploding like they were sacks of ketchup. That kept it from being too offensive, however it wasn't that great a story either.I was moderately entertained hen I wasn't cringing, but I felt the customer reviews built it up too much, and as a result it didn't meet expectations.

"The Black Hole, Disney's attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars phenomena, is full of cliches: cute robots, evil scientists, and square-jawed heroes.The film's saving grace is the premise; solving the mysteries behind a very interesting steller phenomenon - a black hole. I also like the movie's very non-Disney, surrealistic ending (shades of 2001).Sci-Fi fans will find something to like about Black Hole, but look into getting a re-mastered, letterbox version of this film.

"So many things that made the original Halloween an instant classic was the ""why"" behind Michael Myers. I remember watching the original as a child and being scared out of my mind, not by the gruesome acts but by the ""why was he doing it?"" When his parents came upon him after he killed his older sister, he was silent, his eyes were dead, he stood there without an ounce of remorse, THAT is scary. THAT is what aids in the suspense of a true classic.This movie... failed in so many ways, I couldn't even watch the whole thing. The Michael character was just pointless. There are a ton of people who come from lives like that who do not turn killer. Rob Zombie wants to say that a dysfunctional childhood creates killers?

"Scream:Scream was the movie of all movies my senior year of high school.  It was all most people could talk about for the longest time...  Presumably because of how realistic it was.  This wasn't a monster fest.  This was a real person, with a really messed up mind going around killing high school students!  What more could a teenager who loves scary movies ask for?This movie is more suspense than horror, I think.  Yeah, there's blood and a little bit of gore, but that is greatly outweighed by suspense that builds up to the reveal of who the killer is.  This was one of the first movies that really kept me guessing - although I sort of had the surprise ruined for me by my best friend who assured me that I would think the killer was ""hot"" whenever I got to see the movie.  But even though she told me that, I still got tripped up in my thought processes when I was trying to put the pieces together.  Only a good suspense movie will do that to you!Let me not forget to mention the excellent levels of comedy relief that this movie has.  Even though there's a masked murderer roaming their community, the characters in this movie still manage to deliver some pretty funny dialogue.  My favorite characters have to be Dewey and Gail Weathers!  Although Stu was also pretty funny...In all, I thought the story for this movie was completely original (at that time), and was very well acted, directed and produced.  I have seen all of the Scream movies, but I really don't think either of the sequels even comes close to the greatness that the original movie achieved.Every lover of horror/suspense has to see this movie.  It should be a requirement.",1146787200,"05 5, 2006"
"Oh what a time it was being a King of Egypt some3,000 years ago.  Not only were you worshipped asa God and had temples built in your honor along theNile, but upon death, your body was perfectlypreserved through the process of mummification.Secrets of the Pharaohs examines one of the world'sgreatest phenomenons - Egypt's Mummies.  Narratedby Christopher Lee, this 2007 IMAX presentationcombines convincing reenactments of Egypt circa1267 B.C. along with footage of top scientists andtheir studies into forensics that could perhaps leadto medical breakthroughs for modern day cures.Viewers of this documentary learn that Egyptianpriests created the first mummies ever known.The Kings loved life and wanted to live beyonddeath.  They believed that dying was a gatewayto the next world where a paradise awaited them.The mummification process ensured that the spiritof the body was prepared for the afterlife. However,for the longest period of time scientists had noidea to the secret ingredients used for embalming.Enter Bob Brier, one of the world's foremostexperts on mummies.  He is also one of the firstmodern-day scientists who have been able toactually duplicate the mummification process.Secrets of the Pharoahs presents a wealth ofhistory for anyone with a hunger to learn aboutthese ancient times.  For instance, viewers willlearn about Heinrich Brugsch who cracked theheiroglyphic code which led him to the discoveryof King Rameses II's tomb in 1881 with the helpof some local tomb raiders.Of course we get to see footage of lots of mummiescourtesy of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs lives up tothe benchmark that these IMAX presentationsare known for.  The panoramic Egyptian environmentis so effectively brought out in razor sharp detailand enhanced with the dimensionality 3D offersthat it becomes a stunning watch.  There is agreat deal of depth perception here though rarelydoes anything poke out of the screen except forthe opening and closing titles and a quick shotof mummy toes.Ghosting can be a recurring problem here dueto the fact that there is a lot of footage takenin dark environments such as caves lit by torchfire, which results in double imaging.  Not a hugeproblem by any stretch but worth mentioning.The accompanying audio soundtrack is ratherpotent and immersive.  Dialogue is handledfirmly in the center speaker while music sweepsacross the remaining tracks with clarity andforce.  The rears aptly support effect noisesthat include windswept rain and crashes.  Thereis also an abundant amount of LFE activity thatsupports the film's sound effects and music. Inall, the soundtrack is the perfect companion tothe 3D visuals.The disc includes a ""making of"" documentarywhich was shot in High Definition.One of the things that I enjoy most about these IMAXdiscs is that they give me an incredible amount of insightinto modern and historical research -- taking me to thefarthest corners of the Earth, and sometimes beyond itsouter boundaries.If you are looking for an eye-popping 3D thrill-rideexperience, then Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohsis not for you.However, this mildly entertaining documentary will beenjoyed by anyone intrigued by Egyptian history.  Theseviewers will no doubt be fascinated by the film's realisticre-enactments of that period perfectly captured in 3D.",1453075200,"01 18, 2016"

"Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards are at their Best in A SHOT IN THE DARK. The Pink Panther (Inspector Clouseau) films were so popular that once seen you will never forget them. Whether it was the animated image of the Pink Panther or images of Peter Sellers' bumbling yet likeable screen personification of Inspector Clouseau or Henry Mancini's unmistakable theme you never forget.A SHOT IN THE DARK has somehow come up short with the younger fans for no good reason other than its title. It does not say ""Pink Panther"" yet once discovered A SHOT IN THE DARK is a true gem. A SHOT IN THE DARK is a great example of sophisticated slapstick (screenplay by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty based on plays by Harry Kurnitz and Marcel Achard). A SHOT IN THE DARK has Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato, which THE PINK PANTHER did not. A SHOT IN THE DARK focuses on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. It is really more character based and driven than THE PINK PANTHER. In many ways A SHOT IN THE DARK is much funnier. It really defines the character of Clouseau a good-natured inspector who just cannot see the forest for the trees. George Sanders is once again brilliant in another similar role, the type that he perfected throughout his career. This time he is the very sardonic yet stately Benjamin Ballon one of Clouseau's suspects. The cast also includes Elke Sommer (the most obvious suspect to the audience), Tracy Reed, Graham Stark and Martin Benson. The opening shot (shots in the dark) and the nudist colony scenes are great examples of Blake Edwards' direction at his best. Production designer Michael Stringer and cinematographer Christopher Challis visually replicate the idea of shots and murder taking place in the dark or at least in places where passions run uncontrollable.A SHOT IN THE DARK has a much different look than the invigorating and opulent images found in THE PINK PANTHER. Henry Mancini once again delivers a very good score. A SHOT IN THE DARK's main title theme is very good but has been greatly overshadowed by THE PINK PANTHER theme. But can you blame it? A SHOT IN THE DARK is somehow in a league of its own yet it spawned all the great supporting characters found in the subsequent films which we all came to love and couldn't get enough of. A SHOT IN THE DARK was the foundation for what was to come and made the world of Inspector Clouseau so enduring and endearing yet there is something very different and special about this one film. It is somehow etched in a time that can never be replicated. To really enjoy it try to place yourself back in that time.",1337731200,"05 23, 2012"

"The 1980s had a shockwave of horror movies, from slasher sequels to zombie flicks and of course there is the 1985 horror-comedy Fright Night starring William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall and Amanda Bearse, followed by a 1987 sequel with McDowall and Ragasdale returning. Then came the 2011 3D remake starring Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell and David Tennant, which failed to impress critics and moviegoers, barley making a profit. Two years later, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment releases the direct-to-video sequel Fright Night 2: New Blood, which ignored the remake and is actually a new take on the original. Confused yet?Charley Brewster, his best-friend ""Evil"" Ed Bates, and his ex-girlfriend Amy Lee are exchange students in Romania, where Charley happens to glance out his hotel window to see a woman biting the neck of another woman in the building across the street. At first he thought it was his imagination, but he soon learns the woman is his Romanian History professor, Gerri Dandridge, who he is starting to suspect is a vampire.After a fellow classmate goes missing, Charley believes the professor has something to do with it. Later, Charley sees Gerri getting rid of what looks like a body. While she is gone, he sneaks into her apartment, but he has to hide as Gerri has returned. She is not alone as she brought a female prostitute with her, whom she drains and bathes in the prostitute's blood.Charley barley escapes the apartment, but the police don't believe what he has seen, so he turns to his best friend ""Evil"" Ed and his ex-girlfriend, Amy Lee. They all believe Gerri is actually Elisabeth Bathory, the ""Blood Countess.""I had mixed feeling about the 2011 remake, though it was watchable, it was also forgettable. Instead of making a direct sequel to the remake, the producers decided to reboot the franchise once again, with a lower-budget and a cast of unknowns. Fright Night 2: New Blood uses the same plot of the original, but only in a new setting, Romania. This time the vampire is a woman, similar to the original Fright Night Part II, but only using the real-life historic serial-killer, Elizabeth Bathory. I'm not the biggest fans of direct-to-video horror sequels (except for Curse of Chucky), so my expectations were low, but I'm glad to say that I actually like this version better than the 2011 remake. It follows the original plot more closely, but with a Gothic atmosphere and gory horror violence. Fright Night 2: New Blood is a great movie, but the only problem I have with it is the ""2"" in the title, when it clearly isn't a sequel. It should have been titled: Fright Night: New Blood.",1382832000,"10 27, 2013"

"In my opinion, I don't care for this movie. I don't think it's a keeper. Borrow it from the library; don't buy it. It's not worth your money.This movie is about a family of superheroes who aren't allowed to be superheroes. Yeah, it really is that bad.The family scenes show reality at its lowest- somewhere between realistic and fall-asleep boring, I would put it at the fall-asleep boring sections.There are about 3 good scenes in this movie and they aren't that long.The characters tend to speak in monotonous tones, especially Helen, which makes this movie easy to tune out.During action scenes, characters move fast! All their superpowers are in being exceptionally strong or fast or stretchy- no mind or brain powers.This DVD's only redeeming quality is ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" a short 4 minute sequence that is HILARIOUS and not included except on the 2-disc special edition.",1140652800,"02 23, 2006"

"The only reason I'm reviewing this miserable excuse for a movie is to balance the glowing tributes that have been littered all through the site--here is the perfect example of a film that had no reason for existing except that Paramount decided some more money was to be made by sticking a 'III' on the end of a famous title and throwing it into a few theatres.The script is atrocious and none of the actors have any 'spirituality' on their minds with the exception of when their next paycheck will arrive--the first film was inspired, somewhat believeable, and fun.  The first sequel was sappy, but had the beautiful cinematography and background of Japan to compensate, not to mention logical character development.  This has nothing but greed written all over it.By this point, there was no way we would believe Ralph Macchio looks remotely like a late teenager.  Cynically, the plot allows us to skip to the final because the tournament rules state that the defending champion 'only has to fight in the finals.'If there was one redeeming moment in the film, it would have been to extend the training sequences, and ditch the lousy, third-rate attempt at romance.  As it is, the kata sessions seem almost perfunctory and superfluous.I still haven't seen the 4th installment in the series, but this film doesn't make me want to.",1005782400,"11 15, 2001"
"There is not much to say about this film others haven't.It's a remake of Wes Cravens ""Last House On The Left,"" which is still one of the most shocking films ever created.With a higher budget, the acting level definitely rises.But the running time, at 1 hour and 50 minutes, gets very boring.And what ruins the whole movie is a terrible, way too long rape scene that was inserted apparently to only piss off everyone. And I am never bothered by rape scenes; this one was way too much.Then the revenge parts are very underwhelming. In the original movie, the parents went to very different lengths to put down the villians. Instead, this time they basically become the villians and/or slasher killers. While you don't feel that they did anything wrong, it didn't work as a whole.This whole thing was much better when it had the 70's look and usually cut away before anything overly gross happened. This one spares you never, and manages to turn what should've been great into a movie that sucked horribly. Just buy the original; you won't regret it.",1267574400,"03 3, 2010"
"Once again this film (as does the DVD itself) has to be all about Brent Spiner.Oh how I loathe his hammy acting and he just ruins this film. He co-wrote the script which pretty much gave him free reign to shut out other characters (Crusher, Riker, Geordi, even Worf!) while he, himself, got to play 2 roles! Data and B4! UNBELIEVABLE!I purchased the DVD earlier today and was shocked to find that the entire packaging is centered around...you guessed it, Brent!He appears on the front, the back, the side sleeve, the paper insert and even the disc! It would have been nice to have seen Picard alone, bit no..every picture of him either has Brent beside him or looking over his shoulder.This last film by the TNG cast tanked at the box office. Maybe most fans, like myself, just got sick of the filsm always being about Data. Nothing kills a fun time better than an ego.To save this film from a completly abysmal rating, I do give a major plus to Tom Hardy as Shinzon. That boy is talented & I would much rather have preferred screen time going to his character development rather than watching the horribly untalented Brent Spiner sing at Troi's wedding.",1053388800,"05 20, 2003"

"Anyone who loves Gloria Estefan will want this DVD. It is a collection of some of her best songs from her Spanish language CD's and others. Some are concert clips, others are music videos. Some of my favorites include ""No Me Dejes de Querer"" featuring some great looking Cuban men and some really hot moves. ""Oye"" is a great dance stage clip. T""res Deseos"" features a carnival scene which is very cute. The highlights are perhaps her duet with Alejandro Fernandez, very romantic and gorgeous (She doesn't look like she's acting here, and who could blame her?!); and Con Los Anos Que me Quedan, a very beautiful black and white 40's montage. This song is truly beautiful and moving, and this treatment is very touching.In between each item is some ""behind the scenes"" footage. A lot of people are finding this annoying, but I think it's fun.Now the downside. From a directorial point of view the use of slow motion and jerky camera movements is overdone. Sometimes it looks like the motion is running too slow. I was wondering if something was wrong with the DVD. I do not to make too much of this, the quality is by no means terrible, but the sharpness, color and clarity of the DVD could be better.Nevertheless, I enjoy this DVD immensely. Gloria is one of my favorite artists, whom I respect enormously for her promotion of Latin music, language and culture. Never marketed as a mere sex symbol or ""babe"", she is very beautiful and enjoyable to watch. With husband Emilio and the best musicians, arrangers around, she has created a musical product which I think will stand the test of time.

"I bought this according to all the great reviews.  I also figured that since Jet Li was in it that I could overlook Jackie Chan.  Nothing against Jackie Chan's skills, just his acting and choice of films which I have never enjoyed.  I am rating the movie, not Jackie Chan.Let me front load this by saying that I am not a fan of Jackie Chan.  Never have been.  So if my martial arts comedy standards may be a bit different from yours but I want to be perfectly honest about this.  After watching Chan's last movie The Forbidden Kingdom I can safely say I never will watch him willingly again.  I relented to watch after a 15 year fast from his last movie and was immediately sorry I had gone back on my word.BO-RING.  Cheesy bad, all around insulting to kung fu fan's everywhere.  I figured if I fast forwarded to the fight scene with Li/Chan that I would at least feel like I didn't waste my money on this.  I figured wrong.  It was an exercise in annoyance.It makes me wonder if all these reviews are fake.  I've always trusted Amazon.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE/ENJOY TOTALLY CRUDE, RUDE AND LEWD  AND OTHER GRAPHIC DISPLAYS OF THE LOWEST FORMS OF HUMAN DEPRAVITY COMIC OR OTHERWISE PLEASE...PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. Now let me tell you about the movie from my perspective. I an not going to give any details of the story away, but rather give you a brief overview. I don't watch this genre very often unless I think it might be good (we all know thats not very often) and with some much needed new material for the genre. The old and worn out material with the burping, passing gas, naked girls, drunkard's and stoners in their late teens to early twenties throwing the party of the century type of movies. In this movie they do break some new ground by mixing 70's biker grindhouse genre and with their brand of farfetched  and grossed out humor and it worked for me in the first third of the movie, but after the second third it was getting old and wearing on my patience and by the last third I was thinking this just can't end soon enough, I had some good laughs in the first part and couldn't wait for more. What happened? I thought they were trying to pull the old ""lets see who is the grossest"" or see who will gets sick first. prank and for me it was that going astray that ruined the last two thirds of what started out as a grossed out funny movie. The movie does have plenty of the standard 70's biker material like ""gas, grass or a@@"" nobody rides for free and large helpings of twisted, gross, nudity, sex, perversions, gun play, knife play, foul language and violence in a black comedy. Was this worth the time? Sort of? Would I watch again? No. Maybe if I drank or used drugs the whole movie might have been funny with the first third falling out of my chair funny. Since I don't drink or do drugs other than Dr. prescribed I will never know. Darn it!!! 2 StarsRating 0 to 5 StarsStory = 3 to 0  Starts out grossly funny, but falls sharply after 30 minutes (give or take).Acting = 1 to 2  The acting is pretty bad intentionally or not with zero standouts.Direction = 3  Director is no target for the first part of the movie, but looses focus soon after.Fear/Creep Factor = 3  Has some good cheesy creepiness to it.Gore = 3.6  Numerous silly and cheesy gore effects.Sex/Nudity = Plenty/ Plenty of topless scenes too.Foul Language = Everything under the sun and then some.Entertainment Value = 2 The laughs and funny scenes kept gettingt farther and farther apart as the movie progressed.",1377388800,"08 25, 2013"

"Possibly the worst book to movie ever made on top of a remake that was low budget and better made then this piece of trash. First if anyone cared to look up this director's history. You would see he has barely made a few unknown films on his own and most of his career was spent as a stuntman. Which leads me to believe he must of hit his head one too many times to direct this garbage. Secondly did the writers even try to read the first book. The entire movie is only based on the characters of the series and not the story. Because in this version everything is completely twisted and added stuff that wasn't even in the book series. I read the entire series myself for what it is, reading entertainment. Another end of the World scenario and with what I thought would have been better actors and a bigger budget would have surpassed the other films that were made. What I found was a comical remake of the movie AIRPLANE loosely based on the Left Behind Novel. The characters on the plane were so ridiculous that I was actually laughing out loud watching this junk. Easily Minus 5 Stars Hands Down!",1419724800,"12 28, 2014"

"A rather unusual agenda from Tinto Brass, who obviously found his later niche in ""T&A"" movies. Col cuore in gola (1967) is a psychedelic, pop art giallo that can just come from the great era of the late 60's/70's.Starting from the nice credits and music you immediately like this film and this is just the beginning.  Trintignant finds a corpse in a nightclub, beside the lovely Aulin who just says ""I wasn't it"".  Convinced that she is innocent, he wants to help her and wants to find out the murderer.  Aulin's brother should solve this case, as both are searching for him.Though not quite without problems. The Story itself is not that convincing (rather unimportant).But what here is really of interest is the unconventional style of Brass: split screen (even triple split screens) some scenes in black and dark yellow filter and more, and in the ""middle"" of course, the presence of two very convincing leads: cool Trintignant and hot Ewa Aulin (somehow priceless here in white fishnet stockings).  The result is a quite ok giallo with (obviously) strong references to pop art.In the same year Aulin and Trintignant appeared in the avant garde 1968 Giallo masterpiece ""Death Laid an Egg"", Col Cuore in Gola is not great as the Death Laid an Egg film but is definitely entertaining.",1242950400,"05 22, 2009"

"Having heard all the gripes about this film, and having seen that it won the Golden Raspberry awards for worst film/actor/actress, I was really prepared to find a dispicable, horrid, incomprehenisble film.Instead, I found a bit of Hollywood tripe that follows the usual romantic comedy outline with a bit of Quentin Terrantino thrown in. I didn't think the acting was that attrocious (I've seen worse), or the story that stupid (I've seen worse), though it never really amounted to anything I cared much about either. I really think this film, though it doesn't deserve huge praise, got overbashed just because it was the time when it was proper to dis poor Ben and Jennifer.Can't say I recommmend anyone watch it, but if you do, I don't think you'll come away thinking it's as bad as all the publicity would lead you to believe.",1142121600,"03 12, 2006"

"I didn't like this film at all. Not one of the characters is likeable.The story is about a kid with serious emotional problems, who runs away, and befriends a bunch of monsters with similar problems. The opening 20 minutes could have been the opening to Hanible 5, or Halloween to show how the killer was unstable even as a child.I hated the kid from the first 30 seconds when he chases, tackles, and bites the poor little family dog. Then trashes his sister room because he's mad, then attacks his mom and runs away. The movie drags on like a half dead road kill for the rest of the film.If you want to see a good, fun film with monsters and imagination, then see Spiderwick, if you want to watch and equally depressing (but actually well written) film, then watch Bridge to Terabithia.  This movie needs a Doctor sitting next to you to explain the characters. I hate art that needs explaining to have worth, like a painter that throws a bunch of wavy lines on a canvas, then spend 15 minutes telling you about the chaos within humanity.Do not waste you time with this. Even the ending is stupid: The kid just returns home, and eats cake, in total silence... the end.",1262217600,"12 31, 2009"

"ESPN delves into the 1988 Summer Olympics and the much-publicized sprinter's duel between Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis in the 100m final. The film is an oral history of sorts, with interviews from all eight participants in the race, but often devolves into finger-pointing and contradiction. In some respects that's revealing in and of itself - clearly, nobody wants to take any blame for the sad state of affairs that led to such a high-profile blowup, when they're each partially responsible - but in others it's maddeningly frustrating. With their athletic days now long behind them, the only thing many of these former runners have to hold onto is their legacy, and they stomp all over that by slamming Johnson for his positive test, then sheepishly fessing up to their own PED suspensions near the end of the picture. As a historical panorama, this is entertaining - particularly in the build to the race itself - but when the central debate flares up and the runners each begin painting themselves as the victim, nobody's there to hold their feet to the fire.",1371427200,"06 17, 2013"

"The car race industry is very good at cultivating new customers at an early age.  I wonder if the producers of ""Cars"" received some money from the business.Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids.  How much of a movie  like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy?I thought ""Finding Nemo"" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters).I gave ""Cars"" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it.For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend ""Mothering"" magazine.

"Reasons to see this movie: If you're looking for some light comedy, this movie will delivers. It's not hilarious and probably won't have you doubled over, but it'll certainly make you laugh. Additionally, it has a nice message about not being ashamed of who you are.Reasons not to see this movie: The real problem with this film results from what I've listed above. The movie wants us to laugh at a bunch of stereotypical gay figures who aren't given much depth and at the same time leave the viewer with more understanding of gays and lesbians - something it doesn't really accomplish.Overall: It works as light comedy, but it wants to have its cake and eat it, too.

Unfortunately, the movies plot that fell into the same type of storyline that is often repeated in many animated films.  There are some moments of laughter but this movie is probably more enjoyable for the smaller audience than it was for us adults.  I thought this movie was lacking something that others I have seen have had (like Despicable Me 2), not sure what it was, whether it was missing the cuteness factor, or more humor or a better plotline which made it more of an average watch rather than something better than that.",1394841600,"03 15, 2014"

Bad movie with bad plot. Don't waste your time,1469491200,"07 26, 2016"
"There were two movies that came out in 2008 which probably rank among the worst in history, this one and Punisher: War Zone.This movie sucks.  You can pretty much ignore what every character says and just insert something you know from Lord of the Rings or Willow.  You'll be close enough that it won't matter.  Better yet, just watch it in German.  It is after all the director's native language.  As for the plot, again, just make up your own details from what you've read and seen.  You can see the formula revealed without much effort.""But you gave it three stars, dip****!!""Yes, and here's why.  This film is a monument to bad filmmaking, a milestone that may never be surpassed.  It's a clash of opposites though because it is an incredibly expensive, slick production.  I would call it one of the most well-made bad movies ever.  So much effort and expense went into casting, action sequences, choreography and special effects that it should have been good, but Boll made it awful, so awful that I had to keep watching to see how much more awful it was going to get.  Here's a quick breakdown:Farmer's name is Farmer and he's hero Jason Statham (possibly the only good casting choice).Farmer's friend is Ron Perlman who for some reason isn't cast as creepy bad guy.Creepy bad guy is Ray Liotta, which doesn't make sense because he's got in Irish blood in him so he could never be a made man (It's Ray freaking Liotta in a freaking Fantasy movie, what can you say to that!?).The role of Gandalf will be played by Gimli, son of Gloin.The role of Arwen/Eowyn will be played by Leelee Sobieski, who is young, pretty and maybe talented, but honestly, the fact that she is in it at all should tell you it's a bad movie.  She may consider finding a new agent.It's a fantasy movie and Burt Reynolds is in it.  Why?  Because they could, I guess.Burt Reynolds's toadie is Matthew Lillard, which should be another tip-off that it will be a bad movie.So the hero decides to be a hero, fights some nondescript bad guys, rallies more people to fight nondescript bad guys, then it all comes to a head and they all fight the one descript (well, if nondescript is a word...) Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta?? Seriously??).  Lots of fighting and dialogue reminiscent of Star Wars prequel trilogy (low blow, I realize that) ensue along the way.In two words, it's heroicly bad.  If you are a real movie buff, you HAVE to see this movie just to see how bad it is.  It's as if you're watching bad film history unfold before your eyes.  That is the only reason I give it a positive rating, because for better or for worse (mostly worse), it's worth seeing.",1238630400,"04 2, 2009"

I love the original stage play. And I love the tv version which stars Jason Robards. Both of these versions are well written and very funny. But the Frank Capra version just tries too hard to be funny and ultimately falls flat. And they changed the stage play beyond belief. Jimmy Stewart's character was built up and the other characters were cut back. The continuity of the story suffered because of that. But the worst aspect of the movie is the overblown effort of all involved to be oh so funny and zany and madcap. It is terribly overdone. I usually like Jimmy Stewart's acting. But not in this movie. I usually like Frank Capra's movies. But not this one.,1255219200,"10 11, 2009"

"I heard all the hype when this was in the theaters so I was expecting more.  Most of the popular Marvel characters came around after I quit reading comics so younger people may have a different take on the movie than I do.  A varied group of individuals, each with a special talent, unwillingly form an alliance to insure their own survival and end up as a team fighting against an arch villain that wants to take control of the ""galaxy"".  Special effects are well done as is to be expected with CGI.  Some of the conversations are quite cerebral and unexpected for a movie such as this.  There is humor as in the other Marvel movies along with the obligatory bit part by Stan Lee and one last scene after all the credits run but I haven't a clue what it was about.

"Along with ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth,"" this was a present for my wife's birthday.  She loved both (and so did I).  Both of us grew up on Disney movies, so to see a loving, light-hearted spoof of that genre (by Disney, no less) was a real treat.  Amy Adams constitutes the best honest realization of a total fantasy person since Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie.  She is a delight, and her singing is truly magical.  The rest of the cast supported her admirably.  I heartily recommend this movie!",1209686400,"05 2, 2008"
"I was really excited to discover they were finally going to release the LotR trilogy on Blu-Ray, then EXTREMELY disappointed to start reading the numerous reviews speaking of how only the Theatrical versions will be included.  Does New Line not understand that we are coming out of an economic recession and that it has to do REALLY good by its consumers if it wants to SUCCEED in a FAILING home video market?!We're smarting up to your archaic double-dipping schemes.  I don't care if it means we'll have to wait another couple months or more if you need to delay the release to allow for the inclusion of the extended content but it HAS to be done if you want to see a good profit out of this release.I'd also be EXTREMELY disappointed if the extended release (if it happens) turns out to be ONLY the extended versions-likely leading to a recurrence of the triple-dipping done with the original DVDs (Theatrical/Extended/Theatrical-Extended Combo).  Give us the option to be able to watch BOTH VERSIONS in HD in the same set or NOTHING AT ALL!!",1267056000,"02 25, 2010"

"I should say that I hate this movie, but my 4-year-old adores it. That makes me hate it more. The story line is fine, but the animation is terrible. They really churned this title out. Reminds me of late-80s Pixar, which were non-expressive. The characters are bland. I'm not into the legend of Sasquatch anyway. I'm sure your 4-year-old would get a kick out of it, but mark my words, it'll be a tough screening even for juvenile adults. Dreck.",1473465600,"09 10, 2016"
"For a movie with a budget this low, it was actually very impressive. It looked like a group of friends went camping for the weekend, got sauced, and came up with this idea for a movie. It was good in a really funny/retarded way. I think that I write stories that have a better storyline than this.Now the acting, it wasn't that too bad, but it was bad. I did not know that the person who was the killer would end up being it, but I did know that the helper person had something to do with the killings, and I think that it had a twist-kind of-in the end.If you  like movies that are suppose to be scary, but are acutually funny as hell,and movies that look like they were made on a maximum $1,000 budget, check this movie out,, but if you like movies that actually look like they took more than a week to make, stay the hell away from this. In my view. I liked this movie, but I don't have the same opinion as a lot of people.",1209600000,"05 1, 2008"
"THE FACTS OF LIFE was a sitcom that was a spinoff of DIFFERENT STROKES pertaining to the Drummond's former maid Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who takes a job working as the housemother at a an all-girls only private school boarding care called Eastland School in Peekskill, New York and the 4 girls under her care were the spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), the heavy-set, but impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest and gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).Eventually, Jo and Blair had graduated from the Eastland Academy in the 4th Season Finale in the Spring of 1983 and in the Fall of 1983 when NBC kicked off its 5th Season; Mrs. G along with Blair, Jo, Natalie, and Tootie all moved out of Eastland School and Mrs. Garrett had started a business of her own called ""Edna's Edibles"" which all 4 girls worked at until it was burned down and rebuilt into a pop culture-influenced gift store which Mrs. G's sister Beverly Ann Stickle(Cloris Leachman)took over in its 7th Season when this show was moved to Saturdays in the Fall of 1985.This 1986-87 Season is awesome and takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to NBC"".",1345075200,"08 16, 2012"

"It's June, 1939.  The Old World Order is about to be bombed into oblivion.  In September, Hitler will invade Poland, and England and France will end almost a decade of delusional, self-defeating appeasement, which has only made Hitler stronger.  Within the year, France will have fallen to the Third Reich, and England will be left to stand alone, saved only by Hitler's disastrous blunder (invading the USSR) and awaiting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that will bring the US into the war, two years almost too late.FDR, knowing that things are slipping out of control, invites the royal couple to add a US visit to their Canadian trip, so he can use them to put a human face on Britain, for the isolationist American public.  It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship, of sorts;  or as Winston Churchill would put it ""America can always be counted on to do the right thing, after it's tried all the other options.""  So, after two days of formality in D.C., the two power couples decamp to Roosevelt's Hudson Valley estate at Hyde Park, where the King wins America's heart by eating a hot dog.We're kind of simple that way...This film opens in Hyde Park, at the nearby estate of a distant Roosevelt cousin, Daisy, who is summoned to the FDR compound there by his mother, Sara, who says her son feels lonely (He already has a wife, and a mistress, but a mother's concern knows no bounds). The call can barely be heard over the yapping of a black scotty, which if memory serves, the movie neglects to tie in:  It's cousin Daisy who gave FDR his famous black scotty Fala.For all intents and purposes, this is a romantic film about FDR and Daisy, and could have been titled ""I Pleasured The President (And Met The King And Queen of England)"" as it seems that on one cross country drive FDR puts Daisy's hand in his lap, and I don't mean by his knees...  They don't get much into what actually happened between them (she seems to have come into the picture just as he is learning to walk, again, after being stricken with polio) and the King and Queen are little more than props.  This is the same stuttering George VI of which a full movie was made quite recently, but Queen Elizabeth (the mother of the current Q-Liz) is nothing more than a fretting, frowning, worry-wart, none of her fortitude or sense of humor comes through whatsoever.So, you've just read far more history than the movie even tries to suggest, thus if you opt to watch this film, your only question will be:  Why the hell can't I rent it?  I had to reinstate dvd's on my Netflix account to watch this film, so no, I'm not advocating you spend the money to purchase it.  It's good, but I don't see it as worth owning, especially as one would hope it will eventually be available to stream, as it should be.",1402531200,"06 12, 2014"

"Passionate music lover since he was a child and of circus world and influenced by the silent screen comedy artists he love - Langdon, Keaton, Laurel & Hardy- great french comedy master Pierre Etaix started his cinematic career in a brief cameo scene of Robert Bresson's Pickpocket and at the side of also comedy genius Jacques Tati. Painter, professional clown - he shared stage with Charlie Rivel in the Medrano, joined Tati at the Olympia, on his show ""Jour de fete"", became a popular comedian on his country working first in famous salas like ""Le cheval d'or"" and then with his wife Annie Fratellini as comedy couple - and graphic artist - he drew between others the film posters of Tati's Mon Oncle and Les vacances de Monsieur Hulot - he jumped into film direction and the filming of his own stuff joining Jean-Claude Carriere - whom Etaix considers his script writing teacher - in the short film Rupture(1961),co-directed with Carriere himself. Tagged sometimes as the french Buster Keaton - one of his most beloved and admirated comedy artists with Stan Laurel and Charlie Rivel -probably for his precise ""mise-en-scene"", exquisite and very calculated sight-gags and his way of acting - Etaix joins in his films slapstick, classic circus routines and acrobatic bits with sophisticated comedy in films plenty of surreal visual invention. His movies also shine for his great taste for the coreographic visual gag and the funny, very creative use of sound and music. This DVD collection - as the previous french edition - collects all the flicks of Etaix as director - five feature films and three shorts: Rupture, Happy anniversary and his episode bit and tribute to Hulot ""En pleine forme"", added originaly by Etaix, with the other 4 comedy sketches, to his first montage for the 1966's premiere of ""As long as you're healthy"", and later delated for the 1971 re-release. After a long legal battle (20 years) at the side of his friend and usual film collaborator great french scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carriere for the recovery and exhibition of his films, Pierre Etaix extraordinary films has been shown again at the film theaters and finally edited in DVD in what has been in only few years a metheoric resurrection and recognition of the art of this true comedy genius. A wonderful chance to see in wonderfuly restored copies his absolute feature films masterworks: Le soupirant - his feature film debut as director with a plot that reminds in some parts to Buster Keaton's Seven chances -, and YoYo - Etaix's personal favorite and a very beautiful tribute to circus world -, so as his great films Le grand amour - that contains a delightful dreamy scene in which Etaix's bed goes out of his bedroom taking off down the road, stopping to pick up a gorgeous nightied hitchhiker and passing other beds - stopped for repairs, having accidents... -, the episodes movie ""As long as you're healthy"" - that contains between other brilliant comedy sketches a bedtime Hammer style vampire story - and Pays de cocaigne, a satyrical candid camera documentary shot after the events of May 68 and focused on french people vacations that was surprisingly punished by the critics, stopping during many years Pierre Etaix's film career.",1365379200,"04 8, 2013"

"I gave [SAFE] more of a chance than I would anything else, because I hoped and prayed that after 118 minutes, there could somehow be an ending that made up for the silence, the tension, the depression leading up to it. I was impressed by only a few things in [SAFE]. The acting by all involved, most importantly the completely different looking (and sounding) Julianne Moore, is simply excellent. It's understated and drab, just what the film succeeds at best. The music, the clothing and the sets evoke the '80s, the time of the film. The single biggest problem is that you desperately want the plot to lead to a huge ending that wows you, especially after sitting through such a depressing ride of a film - and it does not happen. I just don't get it.",1232236800,"01 18, 2009"

Super cute comedy about a group of straight girls using a newly outed gay teen to become more popular. This is a comedy that takes you back to the 16 candles John Hughes days when smart comedies were around that you loved to watch but can't find anymore.

"What is their about this slasher flick that makes it different from any other? Other than changing the race of the major players...nothing. So this movie did not stand out. The urban angle , as opposed to some dumb kids lost in the woods or venturing into one of those ""lets go look in this building"" places, is still the abnormal for this genre. The story is old. The acting was good, not great. I do not think the race changing will reach any new audience. The special effects could have been a little better. The fight for life scene between Deago and the killer could have been drawn out a little more. Deago was the main a-hole of the April Fools bunch, so his death should have been prolonged and special.  Actually, all of the fight-for-life scenes could have been drawn out a little more. The score was terrible during most of the movie. Being so terrible, it made me realize how important the right music at the right time really is. That being said,it was just okay for a B-slasher flick. The only difference is the victims had sould and attitude. Not worthless, but not worth going out of the way for either.

"As everyone already knows, the first Smokey and the Bandit was and is the best.  This is another of those movie series that suffer from the Tri-Affect, as I like to call it (Any after the initial release will usually be not as good or crap).  I just bought this yesterday and laughed myself silly watching the first movie.  Plenty of action in the form of car chases and crashes, and plenty of humor, mostly delivered by Jackie Gleason in one of his all time best roles.  Then I immidiatly watched Part 2.  Same premise, which is ok, except the Bandit that we all loved is no more.  Down on his luck and forgotten by the majority of his one time fans, Bandit has taken to drinking and is a wreck of a man.  And then we get to the meat of the story, about transporting an elephant to Texas.  It just wasn't as fun or engaging as the first storyline with the beer.  And all throughout the proceedings, Bandit seemed to be in a perpetual funk that never cleared up, unlike the free wheeling careless redneck cowboy from the first movie.  Even Jackie Gleason, while still being fun, isn't as good as the first movie, using many recycled jokes and put downs to Little Justice.  And then we get to the third movie, Part 3.  Burt Reynolds didn't even take part in this one, save for a brief scene at the end.  Jerry Reed played the Bandit.  I must say, however, that this movie was a lot more fun then Part 2.  Reed had grown a mustach and if not a dead ringer for Reynolds, at least looked enough like him to play the part effectively.  Heck I remember when I was a kid and saw this movie on TV, I thought it was the Real Bandit (and kept wondering why the girl called him Cleatus).  So, here we go:Smokey and the Bandit: Two Thumbs up for fun and action that never gets old.Smokey and the Bandit Part 2: So-So for being a giant leap from the fun and humor of the first movie to a darker take on a classic character (I didn't realize that they did this way back then. I though turning already established characters and shows darker was a modern phenomena)Smokey and the Bandit Part 3: One Thumb up for being happier and more fun than the second movie, but just not quite capturing everything that was inherent in the first.

"I have always been a fan of Alton Brown and Good Eats, and have yet to see an episode that wasn't both entertaining and educational. ""More Juicy Meats"" contains three episodes for carnivores dealing with roasts and lamb. The episodes, ""Family Roast"", ""A Chuck For Chuck"", and ""Grill Seekers"" are all fascinating, and the enclosed recipe booklet deals with one recipe per show. Of the three episodes my favorite is ""A Chuck For Chuck"" which deals with a modestly complex but delicious method of preparing pot roast. I don't particularly like to eat lamb, but still found the show's presentation of and recipe for ""Silence of the Leg O' Lamb"" interesting and useful.This is a great series; I particularly like it for its educational benefits, but the quirky teaching methodology and humor makes it the single best cooking show I have ever seen.

"Somewhere down the list one reviewer said everyone giving this set a bad rating was merely whining.  Angry would probably be more accurate.  I exchanged sets three times before finally finding one that contained discs that were all playable (though even that set had three loose discs).  Your best bet is to pick this up in a store so you can shake the box and listen for loose discs before purchasing---but even this method isn't foolproof: a friend bought a box that didn't rattle only to find that two of the discs were still scratched and another froze on every single DVD player he tried it in (six DVD players, just for the reviewer who said everyone with defective discs actually had defective DVD players).As for the quality, the films are washed-out and nowhere near as crisp as the original DVD releases.  The busts are cool, but the packaging is done in the funky green tint without reprinting the great original posters in color.  And as everyone has pointed out, Drac's death groan is gone, and that alone should turn away all serious horror buffs.  And you still have to buy Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein to complete your collection (just as I had to buy this set to complete my collection since this is the first time House of Dracula has been released on DVD).Yes, the price is low, but I would have been willing to pay more to get these classic movies in the the condition they deserve to be in.  What I did was pay 60 bucks for a glorified Van Helsing trailer.The Mummy, Creature From the Black Lagoon, and The Invisible Man all get their Legacy treatment on Oct. 19.

"""Deanna Durbin: Sweetheart Pack"" is Universal's celebration of the adolescent soprano that MGM discarded after screen testing her opposite Judy Garland in the musical short ""Every Sunday."" In hindsight MGM's decision to can Durbin is sound, though after the success of her debut film L.B Mayer was probably kicking himself. However, although Durbin is a pre-teen operatic sensation she lacks the star power or dramatic acting chops needed to make her a full fledged musical star. Not that anyone noticed during her tenure at Universal. Durbin was one of the most popular and most successful of that studio's stars. But her films lack the effervescent abandonment and stunning creativity behind MGM's Jane Powell film vehicles.  Aside: this collection of Deanna's greatest hits DOES NOT contain the film ""100 Men & A Girl"" - currently advertised on some web sites as part of this collection and undoubtedly the best film Durbin ever made during her tenure. One can only assume that its absence from this collection will result in ""Deanna Durbin: Sweethearts #2.""This collection begins with ""Three Smart Girls,"" Deanna's entr&eacute;e into films at Universal. There is a definite sense from studio big wigs that they were testing the waters for Durbin's public appeal. She stars as Penny Craig, a precocious youngster who conspires with her two sisters to unite their divorced parents. The script is chalked full of musical numbers to cleverly hide the fact that Durbin's primary asset is her singing ability. As standard musical tripe this film trips tunefully by, but it has no staying power once you've finished with it.  ""Something In The Wind"" is a grossly misleading premise for a film musical. Durbin plays Mary, a disc jockey who gets mistaken for her mother, also named Mary.  Mary Sr. has been collecting support payments from her dead lover's estate for some time.  However, when relatives mistake young Mary as the beneficiary, they plot to destroy Mary's credibility as a means of getting the support payments to stop. Once again it's the musical program that rescues this film from melodramatic oblivion. ""First Love"" is the best film in this collection: a Cinderella fable in which Durbin is Connie Harding, an orphan sent to finishing school by a philanthropic uncle. There she finds true romance with Ted Drake (Robert Stack). Ironically, the solid story is buttressed by only a few songs. Clearly, Universal knew the dramatic portion of this film was above par for a Durbin vehicle and tempered their urge to go all out on a song fest. ""It Started With Eve"" is a close runner up to ""First Date"". When the son of a millionaire, Jonathan Reynolds (Robert Cummings) suspects that his father (Charles Laughton) is dying, Jonathan is determined to fulfill a last request; namely that his father should meet his fianc&eacute;e. However, when she isn't available, Jonathan grabs hat check girl, Anne-Terry (Durbin) as a quickie replacement. But his deception backfires when dad makes a speedy recovery.  ""Can't Help Singing"" is aptly the only reason why one would invest time in this trite little tale of Caroline Frost (Durbin), a head strong girl from back east who tackles the old west and romance with a cavalry officer (David Bruce).  Finally, there's ""Lady on a Train,"" a curiously sour note in Durbin's repertoire. She plays a sleuth in a murder mystery opposite a handsome writer (David Bruce, again). There's more than the prerequisite of twists and turns in this convoluted tale but this film is no ""Strangers on a Train"" and, with the inclusion of predictable songs it really can't decide whether to play as a musical or a suspense thriller. Ultimately it winds up being a mutt, half and half: uninspired and pretty forgettable.Universal hasn't paid much attention to quality on this collection. The gray scale on almost all films in this set is poorly balanced with low contrast levels, weak blacks and very unclean whites. With the exception of ""First Love"", the rest of the films in this batch are riddled with age related artifacts and a considerable amount of film grain. Some edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering of fine details crops up now and then to further degrade the image quality. There's also a complete lack of tonal quality in the audio. Durbin sounds exceptionally shrill when she sings and dialogue is often buried under a barrage of pops and hissing that further detracts from your listening pleasure. Ultimately this isn't an outstanding effort - either from Durbin, Universal or the stellar capabilities of the digital format. I don't recommend this set to anyone who is NOT a die hard Deanna Durbin fan.  One final note: the insert for this collection is merely tucked in between the gate fold, making it easy to misplace damage and lose.",1091750400,"08 6, 2004"

"Most of the elements of a really good (or bad, depending on how you look  at it) B-movie are in place here.  The acting is bad, but in a funny, campy  sort of way.  The monsters look kind of cool yet, at the same time,  hilarious.  The irrational actions of both humans and monsters are also a  great source of amusement in this film.  The movie begins right in the  middle of the crisis, wherein the slime monsters have invaded L.A. and  built a wall around the city, but as the scientist and his two daughters  are explaining this horrible apocalyptic situation, they are acting as  though they are going to a tea party.  An episode of hysteria breaks out at  one point as a man the group hardly knows is killed by a monster, yet when  the scientist's daughter is dragged away by the monsters, no one shows any  emotion at all.  Her boyfriend, who is at fault for the occurence, acts  about as upset as if he had just spilled a glass of water.  Maybe not even  that upset.  Some of the monster death scenes are so silly that I had to  rewind the tape several times to watch them over and over again.  These are  just a few of the things I found funny about this movie.  Cheesy B-movie  fans really need to see this one.  It's a very good bad movie!",968198400,"09 6, 2000"
"Movie Summary:  This is the legend of King Arthur as told by author Marion Zimmer Bradley in her book of the same name. It focuses on the women of Camelot and their pagan religion. It shows the changes it goes through as the people of England embrace Christianity.My Opinion: I was hoping for steel on steel action with knight facing knight but instead I got religion versus religion and priest facing priestess. I knew that this version was based on Marion Zimmer Bradley's book, but I did not know that it focused primarily on the women of Camelot and their religion. Avalon it turns out is a hidden island that is the home of the religion that worships the goddess of the earth. They train priestesses here and then send them out into the world to meddle in the affairs of men. Some people may find this interesting, but I was set to see King Arthur and got this instead. The three main actresses do a very good job. Julianna Margulies especially is very good as Morgaine. It's no surprise that Morgaine is portrayed as a victim and not the evil priestess that she is in other versions of the King Arthur legend. Anjelica Huston and Joan Allen also give good performances. In the end it was a long 183 minutes and I was left wanting some action.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1  Sound: DD5.1 Extras: Deleted Scenes, Photo GalleryWhat You Should Do:  If you are a King Arthur purist you should skip this one. This is the story of the women of Camelot. It is written from the woman's point of view, which is quite different in this story.  It focuses mostly on the women and their religion, not on Arthur and the fighting. For some good Arthurian action check out Excalibur instead.Related Movies To Check Out: Excalibur, A Knight's Tale, Monty Python and the Holy Grail",1014336000,"02 22, 2002"

"This is pretty good, certainly better than other Peach DVDs I've seen.  I have one other Peach DVD with the multi-angle ability which was only ok to play with sometimes but not always that useful - here it's really useful for the ""club"" stripping scenes and also ""wet t-shirt"" scenes since the angles are not only different distances but different spots around the stage and none are those silly ""creep camera"" hiding behind objects or whatever.  So with a girl dancing around a pole, it's useful to have multiple cameras so you don't miss anything.  Not all scenes have three cameras however - some only have two and at least one of them had only one (though that scene is on a bed and the camera is the perfect distance - intimate but no myopic ultra zooming).  But the multiple angles was useful in every scene that had them.I was also very happy that there was PLENTY of full explicit nudity here... plenty of genital closeups and several girls had some succulent meaty labia.  Although mostly it's reserved as far as hand touching - you do get a lot of open leg shots or butt in the air on her knees positions but the hands usually just pass over with no grip - here and there some girls did do as much squeezing/spreading as they could get away with and gave some little glances of pink and certainly stretched anus to go with it.I'm cool with ""unconventional beauty"" in the sense that lots of strippers are single moms or whatever, so yes implants are a bit prevalent and so are a few stretch marks, flattish butts, and other signs of maturity.  If anything I thought these girls could be a bit more curvy but hey, muscular stripper legs and all that.  A few of them were pretty voluptuous.  3 and a half minutes is definitely too short though - you blow half of that just taking it off and then you barely have anything left for teasing and showing.  Some of the good scenes are longer though, upwards of 6 or 7 minutes.  But it means there is a move-along-now pace and therefore a certain playful brevity to everything, no real erotic lingering or enough repetition to get you truly going.

"Note:This review is for the dvd and the contents within the dvd, I am not reviewing school rumble as an anime series.Intro:School Rumble is an anime series about high school life.  The series has many characters and that is one of the unique features of this anime.  There is a lot of parody of other animes within the series so those who watch anime frequently will notice this while watching the series whereas as casual viewers will have no clue.  Unto the review!Pro:This is the first dvd which introduces the main cast of characters and the plot of the series.  Here is the list of main characters: Harima, Tenma, Eri, Mikoto, Akira, Hanai, Yakumo, Karasuma.  Each character has a unique feature and that is the main selling point of this anime series.  Magnets included with the DVD and with every DVD released so far!Con:The dvd focuses on Tenma and Harima, whereas the other characters are not emphasized.  The 5 episodes are mostly focused on Tenma and Harima, whether they can confess their feelings to the person they like, pretty much this is repeated throughout the dvd (other volumes have other stories to go along with this; reason why I deducted stars for dvd 1).  Only those who know about anime or read the School Rumble manga (or regular manga readers) will understand the inside jokes displayed as casual or non anime fans will have no clue to what the jokes mean.Conclusion:If you are a fan of school life (particularly high school life) or have read the School Rumble manga then this volume is an absolute purchase for you.  Casual viewers and first time viewers will not understand the jokes going on but I will go on say to recommend it as it helps you to understand the Japanese culture and the anime series gets much better.  Recommended age is 13+ or high school (it makes sense since that's where the series is taking place)P.S. I am a huge fan of school rumble and this review was done fairly for both fan of the series and non-anime viewers.",1196294400,"11 29, 2007"

"While I know there are better scripted films out there in this genre, I couldn?t help but enjoy this movie despite its predictable plot on the premise that it was intended to make one feel good about ones fellow human beings, and it did.  While it certainly isn't cerebral by any stretch of the imagination, it is a good  family film.  It isn't intended to be a great work of cinematic art, but what it is intended to do it does.  It appeals to the child like desire for good to overcome evil, to the desire of a parent to be able to present himself in a good light to his/her children, to the desire for world harmony in a time when it seems perilously close to wide spread destruction.  As other reviewers point out, there is a little for everyone in this film: a brave, decent, pilot... president; a beautiful black stripper with a heart of gold and her adorable little boy; a computer nerd whose knowledge saves the world; an attractive, muscular, black guy to act the part of a good role model for young males; a wedding; a reconciliation--in fact several; a recovered alcoholic father of three who saves the day and makes his children proud of him again; etc.  This is a film that attempts to fulfill the need for fantasy in all of us.  It does so just as Harry Potter does through wish fulfillment; it just does it with more of a ""boom.""  The film is definitely a catch all that was intended to market well by its broad spectrum approach to story telling, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an entertaining tale none the less.  Like The War of the Worlds it's an ""us against them"" sort of film, but unlike the latter, it has it's funny moments, in fact many of them.  Brent Spinner--everybody's favorite synthetic life form--gives a wonderful performance as a slightly off beat and out of step director of Area 51, while Randy Quaid does a brilliant characterization of a derelict and ditzy hero who rises to the occasion once again when duty calls.  Will Smith is constantly getting off witty one liners that seem to capture the moment in pithy humor.  Jeff Goldblum played Jeff Goldblum, just as he always does, but as always too is very entertaining to watch.  My greatest disappointment was the women of the story.  Vivica Fox, as Jasmine, had the most active and interesting role among them, her motivating force being the well being of her little boy and the man she loved.  None of the other women seemed to take an active part in anything.  They seemed just along for the ride,  watching the drama take place in front of them, often showing less involvement than many women do over their favorite soap!  A great disappointment to someone who grew up with Honey West, Emma Peel, the Girl from Uncle and other examples of active female participation in action adventures.  The fine CGI finale makes one  want to ""salute the flag,"" at least of the United Nations, as humanity once again defeats those nasty aliens with our human ingenuity and determination.

"We were expecting a lot from this Lucio Silla to rejuvenate an ""M-22"" collection that became a bit stale following a very good Mitridate. To be fair, the ""scenic actions"" that followed Mitridate are very difficult to put together and the three of them were plagued by problems related to the music (Betulia), the staging (Ascanio) or the singing (Il Sogno). Therefore hopes were held high for this Lucio Silla, the last opera Mozart composed especially for the Italy. Did the team of singers/musicians/stage directors succeed? The answer is a qualified Yes.The positives of this performance are first and foremost the concept behind Jurgen Flimm's staging. By making Silla a true, modern-day dictator and by changing the ending of the opera versus the libretto, Flimm remains true to the spirit of the piece (even if not to it its letter). I have long appreciated Jurgen Flimm's work, particularly in Bayreuth, where he delivered a stimulating and thought provoking ""Ring des Nibelungen"" back in 2000-2004. However, if the concept is good, the execution flounders from time to time. This is due to the fact that Lucio Silla, the title role, has very little to sing - the tenor initially supposed to sing the part back in 1772 was replaced at the last minute by someone with very little theatrical experience and half of his arias were therefore binned. This becomes problematic for the balance of the work and for the balance of Flimm's staging: how do I keep an interest on a piece focusing on someone who is rarely there? The production tends to err on the verge of boredom as a result, even if Act III is an undisputed success, both musically and dramatically. Also worth of note the magnificent costumes of Birgit Hutter.Musically, like the staging, this performance is a mix of good and not-so-good. The star of the evening is the fantastic soprano Julia Kleiter (already in the ""Betulia Liberata"" of the same collection). She has a ringing, crystal-clear tone and her voice is like silk: a revelation. I was also impressed by the Cinna of Veronica Cangemi, amazing stage presence and a fantastic performance in her last aria ""De' piu superbi il core"". Elsewhere this is not so good. We have a professional Giunia by Annick Massis but she does not deliver the ""kicks"" we were expecting. Roberto Sacca also has an almost primal stage presence but doesn't have the voice that should go with it. Most disappointing in our view is the orchestra of the La Fenice theatre in Venice, which played this piece written by a 17-year old a bit too thickly, without the spirit that much less famous orchestra have put in this repertoire so far in this collection (like the Mannheim theatre, the Camerata Salzburg, les Musiciens du Louvre or even the orchestra of Salzurg's university). Tomas Netopil - who was making his conducting debut in Salzburg - led a rather eventless orchestral performance.So overall this is a good DVD introduction to Lucio Silla but you won't find the flames of genius here, even if there is a lot of talent onstage.",1168560000,"01 12, 2007"

"Trevor's headaches and memory loss are getting worse since the accident in which he lost his wife, but as he slowly discovers the truth about the events leading up to the crash, the demons of the past return to torture his soul! If INFERNO was HELLRAISER's take on ANGEL HEART, then HELLSEEKER is this series' version of JACOB'S LADDER. Notes from Lyne's film and Robbins' character can be found embedded all throughout the story, but this actually works in director Rick Bota's favor. Of the later sequels, HELLSEEKER is decidedly the best, with a clean visual style and several strong performances. Every step along Trevor's path holds meaning, and Bota has left us with enough clues so that we may anticipate the ending without completing guessing the shocking revelation in the final scenes. Dean Winters is reserved in the lead role, which allows the audience to identify with him while we share in his search for answers. Ashley Laurence also makes her triumphant return to the series as Trevor's wife Kirsty in a small role that carries a huge significance. Pinhead's highly anticipated arrival in the end brings the character closest to Barker's original intent while serving his dark justice. For anyone who may have given up on the series, HELLSEEKER will come as a welcomed surprise before heading back in to more tiresome sequels.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",1359849600,"02 3, 2013"

"I thought the actors actually did well with the script they were given but it was too biased, glossing over the misdeeds we all now know was part of the fabric of this family. JFK's liason were glossed over, portraying Marilyn Monroe as a mentally unbalanced stalker. RFK was portrayed as a saint, drinking only Dr. Pepper and totally faithful to Ethel. Ethel was depicted as some housewife driving car pools instead of the real woman who simply popped out babies in competition with Rose. I actually felt Katie Holmes did a decent job with her portrayal of Jackie. The whispery voice was close to accurate but little was done to show her redecorating of the white house or the fact that her spendthrift ways was a source of friction between her and Jack. Joseph and Rose Kennedy were probably pretty accurately depicted. From what I've read elsewhere, Rose was pretty cold with her religion taking center stage and indeed influencing her apparent lack of grief over the loss of several children.I don't know if the Kennedy's had any say in how this movie was done. I suspect they didn't have much influence which wasn't really necessary since this was for the most part a puff piece. It could have been better since we now know so much more about the family than was ever admitted in the 60s.",1349308800,"10 4, 2012"

"The French Connection remains one of the classics of film.  For brilliance of portrayal and suspense, it is timeless.The film embodies what drives its two protagonists.  Alain Chanier (Fernando Rey) is a dapper businessman  on the outside, ruthless killer and drug kingpin on the inside.  NYPD  Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman in a deserved  Oscar-winning performance) is a hyped-up cop who pursues his quarry with  glee, but is also quite likeable.  The contrasts are best shown in two  early scenes - Chanier's dapper nature comes through when he and his wife  Marie exchange gifts for their pending trip to the US; Popeye Doyle's  nature comes through in a thoroughly engaging scene when he and his partner  Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider in what should have won him an Oscar) bust a  lowlife junkhouse bar; Popeye accosts men twice his size, pulls  ""dropsy"", and all knowing none of these scumbags will dare  protest.  The raid, though, is cover so Popeye can debrief one of his best  informants (Alan Weeks); the informant reveals the coming of ""a  shipment"" (Chanier's) in two weeks.  To make the ruse look good,  Popeye reluctantly busts the man's jaw (the grimace on Popeye's face as he  does so is priceless.).Adding to the tension is the presence of FBI  Agent Bill Mulderig (stuntman Bill Hickman in a superb performance), who  hates Popeye, blaming him for the death of an officer in a previous case.  The two quarrel several times and come to blows at one point.Through  it all, Popeye trails Chanier and his American friends, lawyer Joel  Weinstock, candy store owner Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco), actor Henri  Devereaux (Frederique De Pasquale), and others.  When Chanier barely  escapes Popeye's pursuit, he has his henchman Pierre Nicoli try to kill  him.  But the sniper attack is botched, and the result is a thrilling  chase; Nicoli hijacks an elevated train (killing a policeman and the train's conductor in the process), and Popeye commandeers a car to pursue.  When the motorman passes out the train crashes, allowing Popeye to corner and then kill Nicoli.  It is the unique nature of  the chase as well as its execution that makes it a film classic.  Most car  chases involve cars chasing cars; a car chasing a train is something that  hasn't been done, before or since.Eventually Popeye and company seize  the car in which Chanier's junk is hidden.  They replace the stash, return  the car, and eventually tail Chanier to an abandoned crematorium where the  switch is made.  A gunfight ensues, and Popeye blasts a man in the shadows  - Mulderig.In the epilogue we learn the fate of the captured hoods, none  of whom get any kind of serious sentence.  The unsatisfying outcome  embodies the unsatisfying outcomes of so many crimes - a further testimony  to this film's greatness.",922924800,"04 1, 1999"

"By the time I came to this movie, I had already gotten there first three. Up in Smoke was fantastic, Next Movie was great, Nice Dreams was good, this was was pretty poor. They get pretty desparate at some points here, and they constantly repeat chracters we've seen already.The Low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals (badly), the astronaut which is Cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space, and then pretentds to jerk off at the end. Also, when they got to ""Harry Palms"" masterbating Champion, that was about as low and unfunny as you could get, just awful. All the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long, including the fake nightclub. The people laughing at Cheech doing a redneck, had to have been payed actors.There are some good points... not that many though. Maybe the wrestling scene, and some of the scene with Chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room. They don't seem to do much in this.

"This show had potential but the script writing is ""So Bad"" ! So for the first 3 episodes there are writing flaws but still entertaining to keep my interest. The major flaws are as follows;1. The story is rushed!! Meaning major character development never takes place to really capture your interest; so, the characters become superficial.2. Each episode is about 18 -20 mins long. it's like watching a trailer to a movie.3. Vampires in this show are as mortal and uninteresting as humans. They just age slower. Lame!!! What these writers don't seem to understand is that the most alluring thing about vampires is not that they drink blood to survive (that's just a limitation) BUT their immortality which these vamps don't have.4. Cell phone / iPod mp3 player interludes are silly and they get annoying. I feel like I'm watching a video game when they cut to those scenes but without a XBox / PSP controller. LOL! - it's just stupid!!!I get to episode 5: Main character drinks blood from her necklace pendant and she goes on some LSD trip that for some reason are events that are actually happening in the show (which is NOT consistent with the other vamp LSD type trips she goes on).The writing is so bad that its just stupid, the acting gets worse because these actors have no background in which to pull from and by episode 5, it makes no sense at all.For those GEN X: remember when MTV was really good 24/7 ""Music""?

This particular transfer is gorgeous in video and audio. Also note the groovy 70's soundtrack...My only qualm with this movie is that even though Peter Cushing is featured on the DVD cover to sell the title, he is only a supporting character in the film.If this sounds interesting to you, I suggest picking it up in the Amicus collection 3-pack for the best value and two more, much better films.",1287964800,"10 25, 2010"

"My living room is tiny and it's very difficult for me to have to rearrange my furniture to do some of the moves.  For props you will need the following:  2 yoga blocks, a yoga strap, a yoga blanket and she also uses something she calls ""yoga cubes"" which looks like a heavy bookshelf, but she makes it clear that instead you can use a table, bookshelf, or a window ledge and also a wall.  Without this yoga cube you will need BOTH a table or ledge and a wall.  Most people have walls and tables so that's no biggie, but the ledge or window needs to be at a specific height for some of the moves to work properly.  Like there's one move where you put your foot up on the ledge/table and she says that it needs to be paralell to your hip.  Well lets hope your ledge just happens to be at that height then.  Where my tv is in my little living room makes it difficult for me to have access to a wall where I'd still be able to watch the dvd while doing the move.

"I like all of the actors and actresses especially Catherine Kenner; however I did not like them in this movie. They could not save this depressing movie about loneliness and boredom. This is an interesting movie about damaged relationships with a few laughs but it's not a good movie. The character played by Julia Dreyfus (Eva) elicits pity and sympathy and Catherine Keener's character is Eva's newly formed best friend (Marianne). They awkwardly share many friendly moments until Julia's character (Eva) discovers that she is dating her new best friend's ex-husband Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is morbidly obese, oafish, stubborn, and dull which left me wondering why Eva was so interested in him. The make-out and sex scenes with Julia Dreyfus and James Gandolfini are awkward and uncomfortable to watch. The dating scenes between them are also awkward and annoying: Albert teases Eva passive aggressively during dates; however, later in the film Albert is hyper-sensitive to any teasing or feedback which later breaks up the relationship. Eva's other friends are equally self-absorbed, bitter, and immature. A few times they even gang up against Eva to spoil her occasional happy and thoughtful moods. Every character is lonely, lost, bored, self absorbed, and slightly narcissistic and each of the characters go through small hardships and growing pains throughout the movie. At the end of the movie they have each other which left me feeling that very little had been resolved between the characters. Eva develops an odd fixation with Albert and attempts several times to rekindle the romance. She seemed like a very lonely woman who had to settle for less which left me feeling sad for her. I felt that Eva deserved better friends and a much better romantic partner.",1401926400,"06 5, 2014"

"Ben Affleck is one of the worst directors in Hollywood today. Go see anything he makes, and it's guaranteed to be derivative and cliched. The Town is a heist movie. There is absolutely nothing original about it. Affleck ripped off scores of movies to come up with the characters and plot of that film.  Even if you can't remember the names of the films, you can remember the familiar plot elements, even the mood. It's the same with Argo. It's basically your typical ""crash land"" movie. A group of people end up in a hostile land populated by ignorant savages and have to figure out how to escape. The ignorant savages in this film are the Iranians, whom Affleck refuses to give any sort of proper motivations for their actions, history or backstory. He leaves it for self-righteous American audiences to determine these people are subhuman and hate progress. Which is absolutely wrong and indicative of a propaganda film.It is hard to connect to any of the film's characters and by the end, the film loses all credibility with the chase scene on the airport tarmac that never actually happened. You see, these Iranian savages apparently have a modern airport, but can't figure out how to call the tower and tell a plane to stop. It's hard to believe this film ever got nominated and awarded for many awards. While I have made it apparent that I thought the film was propaganda, it certainly didn't help matters when the First Lady just happened to show up to announce the Best Picture award. Seriously, when does that EVER happen?Propaganda movies, even for causes I support, are generally an insult to my intelligence. That is exactly what Argo was. Even if I ignored that, the movie was very mediocre. Better movies with this same plot have been ignored or even deemed terrible? Why does this one get so much attention, especially when the story is altered and fictionalized for jingoistic and entertainment reasons? This is yet another blunder by the Academy, which is continuing to ruin its credibility by giving suspect winners Oscars for mediocre or terrible performances.

While there were several scenes that were very graphic in nature, they helped to emphasize the truth of how this story unfolded. Unbridled sex, drug use profane language, it all reveals the dark side that living this lifestyle creates. The consequences are plain for all to see but at the same time, you feel empathy for the devastation these characters have brought upon themselves. Matthew & Jared & the whole cast will have you believing they really went through this themselves. The physical changes in their bodies as this disease progressed were amazing.

"No new poses or interesting flows.  Barkan narrates the video.  The tutorials are not great compared to many other dvds.  FYI, Deb Dobin has a nice tutorial section.  Unless you put the heat on 95 degress or higher, this class is likely to cause injuries to beginners especially because their bodies won't be hot enough to perform a couple of the poses.  That being said; it is NOT an intermediate dvd.  I used a space heater and did it when I was not feeling well and it still bored me.  It should have ended at 30 minutes, not 65.  I have many yoga dvds for all levels; ranging from 30 to 90 minutes that put this to shame.  I wish I could get my money back.But I gave it 2 stars because it's a good pace for a heated room; just a not a great practice.  A few times he throws out words about engaging bandhas but doesn't give explanation of how.  The woman on the dvd has red hands and feet; which grossed me out.  The transition from standing poses to floor poses is really bad.  No inversions either.You are better off just using a beginner yoga dvd or a slower paced one and putting the heat on.P.S. I think the body should create some heat on it's own; not just because of the heater.  This dvd does not deliver on that end; so save your money.P.S.S.

"I think that's the line. I've seen this film so many times I can't count. And, no, I can't spurt out great lines. I've never been good at that.So I'll just say that this is one of the top movies of the 90's, and one of the funniest movies ever. I could keep going with hyperboles, but they're meaningless.What makes this film, as one reviewer said, is the humanity. We actually love these guys. Dignan is obtuse, potentially dangerous (mainly to himself), and an adorable little kid. The three of them fight like 12 year olds. I love it when Dignan feels hurt, then mumbles, ""You know my mom and Greg (?) aren't speaking to me"" (or something like that).The love between Anthony and Inez is sexual and innocent. Surprise. There's no nudity. There's a ""come on, let's run away"" spirit in Anthony. Inez is more practical. First she has to learn English, since there's no chance Anthony will learn Spanish. Something has to be done. After all, Rocky certainly isn't the best interpreter, and Dignan doesn't give the best messages!The reason I mention Grace is because that little 8(?) year old is the grownup in this film. Dignan even feels threatened by her (I won't give away his defensive retorts). I'm sure this is a major theme in Wes Anderson's films. He is fascinated by adults who haven't grown up (Bill Murray in Rushmore), and kids that are wise beyond their years (Grace, Jason Schwartzman's character and his little friend).See this film, even if you don't like it.

"Japanese cyberpunk horror is a hit-or-miss sub-genre. On the one hand we have highly entertaining movies like ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" (1989) and ""Rubber's Lover"" (1996), while on the other hand we have feats of mediocrity like ""Hellevator"" (2004) and ""Meatball Machine"" (2005) or poorly made crapfests like ""Death Powder"" (1986). Rest assured that ""Pinocchio 964"" safely rests within the category of ""poorly made crapfest.""A woman meets a sex slave who is accidentally released into the outside world. The problem with this movie is quite simply this: there is too much time wasted on drawn-out, uninteresting, stupid, disgusting events. For example, the woman attempts to teach the slave how to speak by repeatedly saying ""Pinocchio"" dozens of times. She does this over and over and over again until the viewer is ready to shove a wooden nose through her forehead. In another scene, she walks around aimlessly while vomiting profusely. Nicely disgusting indeed, but did we really need to see her repeatedly throw up a dozen times? In yet another scene, good ole Pinocchio runs through the streets hysterically for an incredibly long period of time. Are you serious?I understand and greatly appreciate the fact that Japanese cyberpunk throws away conventional, formulaic film-making standards and goes for a shot to the heart in terms of a no holds barred visual/audio assault on the senses. That's why I love ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" (directed by Shinya Tsukamoto) and ""Rubber's Lover"" (directed by Shozin Fukui, the same director of this film) - they have boatloads of awesome, exceptionally cool visuals for the viewer to chew on. These aren't your typical ""crazy"" movies with characters acting stupid the entire time. On the contrary, you get wickedly stylish nightmare sequences that blend horrific technology with biological flesh; or Frankenstein-like awakening sequences with psychic antagonists fitted in black rubber suits. Every assault is handled with precision, lasting long enough to leave an impression without provoking irritation. These films are the very essence of successful experimental film-making. Breathtaking stuff!Unfortunately, ""Pinocchio 964"" reminds us more of Tsai-ming Liang in its habit of shamelessly filming completely pointless, dull-as-dirt moments for incredibly long periods of time. The only difference is that where Tsai chooses to film a person peeing into a plastic bag for 5 minutes, Fukui chooses to film a woman vomiting profusely for 5 minutes. Both methods will incite record-setting levels of frustration and irritation on the part of the viewer. These types of films are not just poorly made by conventional standards, they're poorly made by ANY standard. Being weird (in and of itself) does not guarantee an entertaining film. ""Pinocchio 964"" serves to remind us of this.I find it incredibly interesting how so many people fail to apply logical standards to films that fly outside conventional film-making techniques. It would seem that dramas and romances are the only genres of film where viewers go in with a defined set of standards (e.g., acting, story lines, etc.). Trot out a no-brain action movie, and everyone gets confused. Instead of everyone rating those films based on the quality of the action scenes (the only logical way to go), we get snobs trashing every no-brain action film in existence (regardless of how well the action is executed) while fans of the genre rate every movie highly (regardless of how badly the action is executed). In like manner, fans of Wuxia films will never admit that a Chinese swordplay movie made in the 1980s or early 1990s was poorly made, while fans of the Classics seem to think that every film made before 1970 is a ""masterpiece."" There is something seriously wrong with all of these people.Am I the only living person on the planet who can be a fan of almost every genre of film while maintaining some semblance of quality control? It's really not that difficult to watch and love a Yasujiro Ozu film one night, only to then watch and love a Prachya Pinkaew movie the next night. Different standards apply, and while movie-watching is ultimately subjective, viewers would be wise to apply some semblance of standards in every genre. That way, we don't end up mixing garbage like ""964 Pinocchio"" or ""Eraserhead"" with truly scintillating fare like ""Rubber's Lover"" and ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man.""",1233792000,"02 5, 2009"

"This should be a suitable film for most but there are a number of  problems which would influence its acceptability for certain groups. It does not have subtitles for the hearing impaired. Happily, this is made in the old-fashioned way, all the speaking is articulated and given the volume to be understood by anyone who is not in the more serious categories of hearing impairment. Still in all, no  DVD made in recent decades should have been deficient in this respect. For some in  the potential audience, who are extremely conservative (in a social not political sense), the language will, on occasion, be over the line of propriety. I do not think this is true for the larger segment of the public but these people should be aware of the problem so as to avoid, what to them, is an impropriety. One reviewer mentions some language bothersome to their religious sensibilities, I did not notice this, but potential watcher beware.For myself, it was a movie that, as they say, kids of all ages, could enjoy (with that pleasure, of course, diminishing in inverse proportion to their  actual age). It is the theme of Pinocchio. Wizard of Oz, and who knows how many other classic stories, becoming human through  the induction of certain characteristics. The robotetry (after puppetry and similar words) was quite well done, the good guys (and gal) suitably nice, and the villains suitably villainous. While much is simple minded slapstick, physical and verbal, as the use of the Three Stooges clips remind the adults watching, this is what kids get a kick out of .At any rate, with the exceptions I point out, this is a young peoples movie which allows the adult to sit in without an eyeshade and ear plugs.",1365379200,"04 8, 2013"

"His tampering is malicious and unending. People think that I've overreacted sometimes in the past but it looks like this new 'Nooo!' revelation might be the final straw for a lot of otherwise committed fans. Even for fans that normally would blindly bend over and over again for Lucas' repeated buggerings this could, and should be, the final straw. How many times can fans bend over before their a** is bloodied and raw?!I stick to my difficult and final conclusion that Lucas has indeed lost his mind. It doesn't take Nostradamus to realize that he will never, EVER stop tampering with these cultural masterpieces, which I personally believe is open contempt for his creations and his fans.I have my untouched/unedited VHS copies that look and work perfectly fine, and although I'm sure in his sick and twisted mind he would like to destroy every copy that doesn't fit his demented revisionism, mine is safe and sound on the shelf until the next viewing, unfettered by the madness and endless tampering of Darth George.",1314748800,"08 31, 2011"
Great story with alot of old school favorites! Great series!,1440460800,"08 25, 2015"
"I will admit that the entire series on Blu-ray DVD combo for $60 MSRP and a current $43 price is more than fair. You get all 26 episodes here. Good bang for the buck.  Also note that this is a re-release of an existing series in the US by Geneon, who went under a few years ago.  Funimation picked up the license for this series.So why 3 stars?  The problem is that the series just isn't that great. It starts off promisingly enough, but the characters start becoming less interesting as the series progresses. You really do get a lot of the 'whiny' style characters, obviously many are based off Evangelion characters. The series goes in a more space age futuristic style though. I would compare the world to that in Eureka Seven (which is a better series by far).  The character designs were all by Hisashi Hirai, who is famous for Gundam Seed and a few other series.  The mecha designer is Naohiro Washio, famous for StarCraft and Gundam 00.  If you notice, the characters are remarkable similar to Gundam Seed characters and the mecha are similar to the Thrones and the Enacts in Gundam 00.  This only serves to render comparison to superior series with superior writing.The writers seem to relish in killing off characters right after they seem to become more interesting. One example, a character says it's his last battle and he is stepping down to take care of his kid. Then he gets twisted into a bloody corkscrew in that last battle. Nice. But that kind of sums up what happens throughout. The problem is that the series starts well, so you are hooked into it. By the time you near the end you just keep pushing forward just so you can finish it.  I discovered that they switched chief script writers halfway through.  Tow Ubukata, took over halfway through, he is famous for Le Chevalier D'Eon and Mardock Scramble.  Both of those series were uneven in my opinion as well.The voice acting is pretty good, though not to the level of matching characters up like in Gundam and Code Geass (another two series much better than this). The intro music is pretty awful. Some people may enjoy it, but it was like nails on a chalkboard to me. The character designer did work on Gundam SEED, and you can really see the similarity to those characters, so much that Kazuki looks like he could be Kira Yamato's brother. The designs of the Fafners are pretty neat, but not as slick as the mechs from Eureka Seven or as well designed as those from Gundam 00.The animation is superb though, but it's pretty without substance. Kind of like the hottie at the bar who is amazing until she opens her mouth to speak. This is a series better seen and not heard! First half of the series is a solid A, second half is a C-.  It's just your standard mecha anime filled with cliches and characters who just aren't that endearing.  Gundam 00 is a much better purchase for a series in this style.

"In retrospect, the only good things about this film were a) we saw it in a spanking new theater, b) aside from me and my wife, there was only an elderly couple in the 100+ seat theater, which allowed me to fart freely, without distracting sneers from those I might offend with bowel scents, and c) it was stadium seating, which meant I could rest my feet up. Other than that, this film was the Al Pacino Scarface, sans drugs and bad Cuban accents but plus gaudy costumes: i.e.- bad, but highly mockable. Can I recommend such a melodrama? I don't know, I really don't- unless shadow puppeteering is your bag. Move over, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, here comes Lousy Liz and the Spanish Armada!",1221004800,"09 10, 2008"
"""The Hobbit"" was a little disappointing in that they overdid the CGI for the fight scenes and especially the absurd rabbit sled (however, the Goblin King was well done) and over-dramatized things a bit.  Seems like their target audience was children and adults with below-average intelligence but that is par for the course now with movies.  With the laughable rabbit sled and childish guffaws it made me think of Episode I.  The analogy is pretty strong - popular trilogy followed by another trilogy ""prequel.""

"This movie is...wow.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw this film.  They CLONED RIPLEY!  What kind of cheap piece of crap is that?  Jeez.  And by some genetic miracle the queen inside of her was cloned as well, yeah that makes perfect sense.  But...but...they couldn't totally separate the queen and Ripley DNA.  Woah, so now we have TWO mutant clones.  Surely madness will ensue from this.  I as well as many people didn't really like the amount of sci-fi in this movie, really breaking down the alien and seeing every single part of it lit perfectly.  Then naturally, the alien drones are super-intelligent and naturally escape from their captivity and proceed to take over the whole ship.  Oh yeah, and Winona Ryder is some really pissy negative android who hates herself.  And a lot of really irritating characters are the crew that brought over the humans for the eggs laid by the queen to impregnate.  As I said, much goes wrong.  One thing I've noticed about all the Alien movies is the token black guy.  Sometimes there's more than one, but the black guy never lives to see the end.  Anyway, what is there to like about this movie?  I really don't know, you get to see really bad digital effects(by anyone's standards), really REALLY cliched characters badly acted, Sigourney Weaver mating with an alien, the queen giving birth to Ripley's love-child hideous white thing that...just...wow), Ripley having to kill said love-child really really gruesomely, and the tease for ""Alien 5.""  This movie flat out sucks, through and through.  It's no wonder it's taken Fox another seven years to put the alien back on the screen.  Don't buy this movie and don't rent it.

"Ive revisited this one a few times and its one of my favorite noirs. Some may call it a B-grade noir, but I think it has a great story with a perfect antihero.99 River Street is about an ex-boxer who is living a down and out life as a taxi driver, with a wife who is neither supportive nor honest. Ernie (John Payne) had been barred from the ring because of a serious eye injury, so he drives to make a living. From the get go, you get the sense that his marriage is on the rocks. The big conflict comes in the form of him being set up and framed for murder by a slick and seedy con man. Along the way, an aspiring actress (Evelyn Keyes) joins him on the quest to clear his name, and to find the one responsible for the murder.Payne does an apt job as Ernie Driscoll, a working class man of principles and ambitions, but with one major flawa vicious temper. Still, Ernie is a redeeming character you want to root for.99 River Street has everything you look for in classic noirvillains and heroes, atmosphere and mood, suspense and intrigue. Great film and the quality is very good too.",1388016000,"12 26, 2013"
"This was made four years before SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and was based on the earlier Thomas Harris novel RED DRAGON.  They did not call it RED DRAGON, because there was another movie that year with DRAGON in the title that did  not do so well...and the studio feared it would get confused with that  film.  It's driected by Michael Mann who is famous for MIAMI VICE, and yes  it shows in this film.  But it's a grueling fast-paced reality-based  thriller similar to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Big challenge is they had to  vocalize Will Graham's thoughts in the book into actual lines in the movie.  Sometimes you can tell the film was made on a smallish budget in the  mid-80s, but on the whole?  It holds up today as a great adaptation of a  great book!  It's a fun movie, and if you are a fan of the other thrillers  like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS this will be right up your alley.  Yes, there is  a wonderful appearance by Hannibal the infamous cannibal -- though not much  is made of his modus operandi.  He is never referred to as a cannibal.  But  Brian Cox's portrayal is strong if brief.  The real stars here are the  actors portraying Will Graham and the killer.  Both give creepy a human  edge as they play cat and mouse with each other.  And fans of Joan Allen --  her portrayal of the blind Reba is amazingly well done.  Sexy and stylish,  not too much gore, and very tight pacing.  I can't be more effusive about  this movie.",964396800,"07 24, 2000"

The entire story in fact is built upon a rather weak premise that is never explained fully.  I guess it could be an allegory where ""it"" is Sin.

"This was the great British hope for a stunning new SF show. Instead they came up with something only marginally better than wallpaper. Poor characterisation, awful dialogue, poor plotting, highly derivative scenes  (one a blatant rip-off, even down to the dialogue, from the Star Trek  episode ""The Immunity Syndrome""), and virtually no pace  whatsoever, the only thing worse than this is Sliders. The whole things  comes across as hastily written with no time spent on telling a good story  and telling it well.

"A Film by John McTiernanI didn't like it.  I'll make that clear from the start.  I thought the movie had some potential and had its moments, but McTiernan kept throwing huge twists and swerves at us and ultimately the movie threw one too many twists and just killed the whole thing.The movie opens with some horrible narration by Connie Nielson, but we move into a Ranger training exercise.  West (Samuel L Jackson) is the training leader and he takes his men out on a live fire exercise.  The scene shifts to a chopper coming in and we learn that it has been 6 hours since the men were supposed to check in.  Nobody has.  The soldiers in the helicopter see flashes of gunfire and realize that the surviving men are firing on each other.  Two men are rescued, one goes to the hospital and other is taken in for questioning.  The non-injured soldier is interrogated by Obsorne (Connie Nielson).  He demands to talk to a Ranger and makes a mark on the bottom of a sheet of paper that seems to spook the base commander.  The base commander calls in a disgraced former Ranger/DEA agent (who is currently under suspicion of bribery, but is an old friend, Hardy (John Travolta).Hardy interviews/interrogates both surviving Rangers and he gets different stories, so he keeps on going back and forth between the two of them and the stories keep changing, as if they are adding on to each other and building and adapting the stories for Hardy as he brings new information to each Ranger.  Thus far, the story is told in a similar fashion to Courage Under Fire (a superior movie to this one).  The problem is that Basic keeps throwing twists and turns until it no longer makes much sense nor could I keep caring when something changed again.  By the time the last twist is thrown as the very end, and I realized that this invalidated the entire movie, I also realized that this last twist killed quite a bit of the internal consistency (whatever was left) that the movie actually had.  I'm not going to give spoilers for the film, in case anyone does want to see it, but if you think back on the movie (after watching it), one or two comments make more sense and the rest make a whole lot less sense.The bottom line is that this movie stinks and was a disappointment (even going in with low expectations).  Sam Jackson gives another scene stealing performance, but it is completely wasted.  Connie Nielson was flat and uninteresting, and Travolta was serviceable (no more than that).  Basic tries to do too much with too little and turns out to be an utter waste of film.",1059436800,"07 29, 2003"

"Obviously the people who made this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to make: (1) a mostly family-friendly movie about a man who is oddly naive (and oddly likeable) who goes through life making ridiculous choices that get him in trouble and whose sisters, unlike the rest of the population, don't think much of him.  Or (2) an edgy, adult comedy about the quirky sex lives and weird family dynamics of several sisters.  Just as I would start almost enjoying one movie, the other one would creep in and take over and I would have to adjust to that movie.  The part about the brother was funny in places, though not really all that engaging, but then these sex things would all of a sudden pop up for no discernable reason and I'd find myself losing the plot while I pondered what the point was in putting in this or that subplot.  And it's not that there were so many sex scenes, either, or that they showed much more than just kissing most of the time.  Just one now and then, when you didn't expect it.  I kept getting the sisters confused with each other, also, so it was hard to keep track as to who was having sex with whom.  However, I'm pretty confident that one brother-in-law was having some fun while he was supposed to be in a meeting (this one included some nudity), one sister is bi-sexual and possibly cheating on her lesbian live-in (two of the sisters looked a lot alike, so I had trouble knowing who I was seeing sometimes) and so on and so forth.  I got tired of trying to keep track of what was going on and realized that I didn't care how it ended.  I figured the brother would come out alright.  In spite of the title, he was the only one in the family with any brain cells, so far as I could see, and that is NOT a compliment to him or his family.  And I figured the sisters would either wake up to the fact that he's smarter than they are, or they wouldn't and I really didn't care which.  There was also some profanity, which nearly always turns me off, especially if there isn't any real reason for it.  If all this sounds intriguing to you; rent it or wait till you can get it a lot cheaper, but my advice is, skip it.",1325376000,"01 1, 2012"

"First, I should say that I've been a Muppet fan for umpteen years.  Jim Henson was a genius, and I miss his sly humor and creativity.  Kermit is still my hero.  That said, I have been looking forward to seeing this latest Muppet movie.  I really like Amy Adams (she was great in ""Enchanted""!)  On the positive side, I liked the story, liked seeing some of the older Muppets, and was glad to see/hear that Steve Whitmire is doing an admirable job (better than initially) as Kermit.  The cameos were fun, and Jack Black was a good choice to be starring with the Muppets.I know that Muppet features are made to appeal to kids and adults, on different levels, which this accomplished, but not to the degree of the Henson era.  Maybe I was comparing this one too much with the original ""Muppet Movie,"" with its wonderful cameos and puns and special effects.  The only word I can think of to describe this feature is ""hokey.""  Yeah; I know it's supposed to be corny, and I expect (and enjoy) the corniness.  And there's probably a fine line between corny and hokey.  In my opinion, this movie crossed the line.  I miss the chemistry of Henson and Oz, and to me, you can definitely sense the difference between the original and current performers.  It was an OK movie to see once, but I probably won't watch it again.  I'll look forward to ""The Muppets....Again,"" though.",1359072000,"01 25, 2013"

"""Being John Malkovich"" is both one of 1999's best films and also THE weirdest.  A brief summary: a man (John Cusack) finds a portal which you can go into to enter John Malkovich's head.  After fifteen minutes, you  are dropped out of the sky just off the New Jersey turnpike.  He and a  co-worker decide to sell tickets into John Malkovich's head.  That is,  until he finds out.  And that's barely the first half of the film.  It just  gets weirder aftrer that.""Being John Malkovich"" is the product  of a brilliant script and very creative directing by Spike Jonze (who  starred in ""Three Kings"").  The acting is incredible and very  believable.  John Malkovich (""The Messenger,"" ""Dangerous  Liasons"") was both intelligent and brave to take a role in which he is  deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nomination and haillarious as he makes  fun of himself.Anyone who can appreciate the bizarre (think ""12  Monkeys"" bizarre, but this is far better) will love this movie.  It is  not science fiction for those who dislike such films.  It is a hillarious  comedy with so many twists and turns one viewing does not serve this  amazing film justice.

"""Lovely and Amazing"" is precisely that - an amazing drama about the struggles of ordinary women trying to feel better about themselves in a world that is too often harsh and cruel. Though the movie itself centers on a mother and her three daughters, their struggles are universal and can apply to men as well. The fantastic ensemble cast makes this a fine drama which had me cringing, laughing, and crying.Brenda Blethyn plays middle-aged Jane Marks who is mother to two adult daughters, i.e. Michelle (Catherine Keener), and Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), and adoptive mother of eight-year-old Annie (Raven Goodwin). Jane appears sensible and has plenty of suggestions and advice for her two adult daughters, yet she herself suffers from insecurities about her body image and decides to have a liposuction. Michelle is a thirty-something artist who can't seem to get anyone interested in purchasing her art and flounders in her marriage. Then there is pretty Elizabeth who struggles to find acting parts whilst feeling insecure about her body (not helped by an unsympathetic boyfriend). Eight-year-old Annie finds herself trying to fit in with this adoptive family, made even more difficult by the fact that she is African-American and her adoptive family is white.There are many real moments in this movie which are compellingly portrayed. Michelle's sense of insecurity about her marriage manifests itself by outbursts of anger and getting involved in an inappropriate relationship. Elizabeth's doubts about her talent and body image manifests itself in her penchant for bringing home stray dogs and caring for them. As for Annie, Raven Goodwin delivers a compelling performance (amazing given how young she is) as a conflicted and confused young girl who struggles to adapt and assimilate, and there's one scene involving a hair makeover that really saddened me.The actors deliver credible performances - this is truly a movie where the female actors dominate, yet I felt the male actors though acting in secondary roles, managed to carry their own. Dermot Mulroney shines as the actor/playboy, Clark Gregg as Bill, Michelle's husband, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Jordan, the high school student who manages a photo processing store! The movie benefits from good direction and I would highly recommend this to fans of movies that explore everyday people coping with life's struggles.",1282953600,"08 28, 2010"

Neither of us could stand it. If it wasn't for the many opportunities to make fun of the movie, we would  have chucked it before the ending. Nazis have built a super air ship and a Hitler transformer deep beneath Antarctica--and they are rotting zombies in need of new flesh to wear. Enough said. Horrible acting, special effects, dialogue, plot, etc. A gag movie for a gag gift.",1406592000,"07 29, 2014"
"Mary Higgins Clark is a wonderful writer, and weaves interesting plots, with many cliffhanger twists and endings. Do not expect to see any of that here. Frankly, I couldn't even get through some of these movies, although I had waited to receive  them with some anticipation; the only anticipation I found, however, was waiting for a speedy end to watching them.I am writing this because after having read other reviews here, I chose to give this a shot; I wasn't expecting a lot, just something pleasant to remind me of the three books I had read; I was hoping to enjoy  a couple of others I wasn't familiar with..The acting was abysmal, and even Jill Clayburgh, who has been known to give good performances, could not save the lousy script or the terrible directing. I got confused as to the plots, even though I had read the books they came from !  The only thing I think these are good for is for film students to see what not to do in a movie; for the rest of us, if it's possible, I would be to return them; no one deserves to get these as a present !",1485993600,"02 2, 2017"

"This is a long but interesting character study of a real-life person: General George S. Patton, probably the most famous military men of World War II.  Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.  As for special-effects, the explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now approaching 40 years old.Nonetheless, if you enjoy character studies, this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6-minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That, and the rest of his performance and this movie in general, is one you won't forget.",1238716800,"04 3, 2009"

"Within the first ten minutes of this move I felt that it could be a waste of 90 minutes of my life.  I was right.  Simply put, there are just better movies about bank robberies.  Such as Inside Man, with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington.  The Bank Job is very thin on plot and the development of the story line is slow and boring.  In addition, there is not any real action scenes to speak of.  Not in the traditional sense of blowing stuff up, cars chasing down the streets and fights, that is what keeps people entertained.  This movie rocked me, to sleep that is and made me second guess what I was watching it in the first place.Since this movie is partly based on a true story I hope that the real bank robbery that took place was a lot more fun and adventurous than watching this movie.

"Has anyone else noticed that it is not permitted a female on tv to actually be satisfied with anything ever for more than 2 minutes or so?  They hook up, they agree on terms, but within minutes they are saying, ""Charlie, we need to talk.""  ""Evan, something is wrong with you and I don't have the love or time or patience to bear with it.""  It's always the guy who needs to fix something and become the female's perfect partner.  Or else.  Or else she'll move to New York.  She'll find a new guy to fix.We never see this happening the other way around.  Guys are constantly jumping through hoops to stop the whining.  They are chronically dissatisfied as well, but it's not allowed to blame females anymore, so for them it's the job.The old wisdom was that the things of this world never do satisfy, and the way to happiness is through ignoring the endless clamorings of the flesh, making a vow, taking a stand, getting through the hard times together.  When did females become so weak, so unable to bear the slightest hardship?  Is this what liberation has brought us to?  Can we be strong, decent, faithful people when we have so much choice, when it's so easy to complain and move on?This show is extremely demoralizing and depressing, perhaps because it so accurately portrays the spiritual vacuum most people live in.

"This is a well acted convoluted tale of multiple deceptions, written and directed by Quintin Tarantino. Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an air hostess who acts as a cash courier between Mexico and the U.S. for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Another of Robbie's couriers, Beaumont Livingstone (Chris Tucker) has been arrested so Robbie arranges bail for Livingstone from bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), picks him up from jail, and shoots him to prevent him from cutting a deal with the police for reduced jail-time. ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LAPD Detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) are hot on Robbie's trail after Livingstone has already traded information for his freedom. They intercept Brown as she returns to the USA with Robbie's money, but as she is also carrying drugs, they arrest her. Fearing that Brown is now going to give information to the police, Robbie goes to bail bondsman Cherry again. So begins an elaborate series of stings and counter-stings, details of which would spoil the enjoyment of the movie. In the process, an associate of Robbie's, Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), and Robbie's girlfriend, Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda) are killed.

"I got this DVD via a BuzzFlash promotion, and watched it w/my wife recently. It contains a LOT of thought-provoking information regarding the blatant antisemitism of since-discredited Ted Haggard's New Life (mega)Church in Colorado and their attempts to ""evangelize"" the nearby USAF Academy, the Sixties schism between antiwar liberal Catholic priests like James Carroll himself (who left the priesthood in the Seventies) and Rome, and the Roman Catholic Church's complicity in the Holocaust thanks in no small part to the German Vatican envoy who became Pope Benedict!There is also a great deal about Carroll's own upbringing as a Catholic in an influential Air Force family - which is interesting in its own right, but unfortunately dilutes the narrative here, and give some critics ammunition to claim it's strictly personal rather than an across-the-board indictment of Christian antisemitism. The presentation also skips around far too much between Haggard, USAF Vet Mikey Weinstein, the Jewish Quarter in Venice, Sister Rose Therling's life, the Holocaust, Pope Benedict, Carroll's own experiences as an Air Force Brat and later priest, the Vietnam War...and a bunch of other stuff as well, and is clumsily handled in too many cases by the documentary's director, Oren Jacoby.In the end, I believe this is an important, thought-provoking documentary with a lot of useful information - poorly handled. The poor handling extends to the non-anamorphically enhanced DVD, which will make viewing annoying to those w/widescreen sets.",1233273600,"01 30, 2009"
"`Wasabi', a film directed by Gerard Krawczyk and more importantly written by Luc Besson (`The Professional', `The Fifth Element', `La Femme Nikita') and starring Jean Reno (of many of the same films), is a French take on the American Dirty Harry / Axel Foley type of loose cannon policeman played by Jean Reno in place of Eastwood and Murphy. This may be a bit odd as Reno is much less the hot Murphy figure as he is the French equivalent of the modern Noir hero as played by Harvey Keitel. In fact, Reno and Keitel played exactly the same role in `La Femme Nikita' and the less successful American remake.The unfortunate thing is that while the plots of `Dirty Harry' and `Beverly Hills Cop' are an interesting framework on which the rogue cop struts his stuff, the plot of `Wasabi' is almost inconsequential. That doesn't mean the film is not fun to watch, as Reno and his two primary supporting characters do great jobs of bulking up their characters to fill out the absence of a meaningful plot.The story, briefly, is based on Reno's character, Hubert Fiorentini, a Paris policeman and former French intelligence agent in Tokyo is summoned to Tokyo because he is the only beneficiary in the will of a Japanese girlfriend who jilted him 19 years earlier when they both worked in the French embassy in Tokyo, Reno as an intelligence operative and girlfriend as a crypographer.In Tokyo, we meet the second of the three main characters, an operative colleague of Fiorentini both were France's covert strongarms in Tokyo. Soon, when Hubert sees the lawyer probating the will, we meet the third major character, the 19 year old daughter of the Japanese code breaker and our Hubert. Daughter does not know Hubert is her father, and threatens to kill her father when she meets him. Daughter is a chip off the old Nikita character block, slightly younger, less larcenous, and certainly less dopy, but just as manic and irresponsible.The big surprise which drives what is taken for a plot in the movie is when Hubert discovers that dead girlfriend / mother has $200,000,000 in her Japanese bank accounts in trust for soon to be legally adult daughter. It seems, however,that this money was somehow taken from a Japanese gangster who does a rather poor imitation of Italian-American gangsters as depicted by directors far less talented or imaginative than Martin Scorsese or Frances Coppela. With a combination of the fact that our Nippon scarface (yes, he has prominent scars on his face) has relatively inept bodyguards and the fact that our hero Hubert is something of especially adept at fanciful means of incapacitating bad guys, Hubert is able to keep himself and daughter out of scarface's clutches for most of Act II.In the last act, with the help of some heavy duty hardware from the French Tokyo cold war stash of weapons and Hubert's Tokyo wingman, Hubert ultimately teletransfers the money out of the bad guys' clutches and take down the whole gang with help from his long dormant network of Tokyo operatives.The fact that it is so much fun to write this review is a sure sign that the movie is fun to watch, at least once. The problem is whether or not the DVD is worth buying. The thin plot never explains how dead girlfriend got the 200 million bucks from scarface or exactly how girlfriend died or what connection a hidden notebook had to the case or even why the seeming larceny occurred many years ago, as 4/5 of the loot was interest, which could only have accrued over many years.The point of the title is based on no more than a sight gag of Reno's character eating gobs of undiluted Wasabi with no sigh that he senses the very high heat in this Japanese horseradish. The point is made when faithful henchman eats a small portion himself and is rewarded with a scorched mouth which he demonstrates clearly with mumbles and large amounts of drinking water.Very few comedies wear well after multiple viewings. Aside from Shakespeare's comedies and Woody Allen movies, there are very few I consider worth owning, and this is not one of them, although I sincerely enjoyed the experience of watching it the first time, as I am something of a Jean Reno fan.Note that like most French movies, watching with the original French soundtrack and English subtitles is superior to watching the dubbed English, as you always loose something in the inflections of the dubbed speech. And, the two translations are different, and based on my rudimentary High School French, I think the subtitled translation is better.",1251331200,"08 27, 2009"

"In a world where no one knows the concept of truth because no one knows how to lie we might ask, ""but where are the politicians?""Seriously though, brilliant concept for what can be, at times, a laugh out loud comedy with more than a bit of a message. Some fantastic setups for taking shots at religion, preoccupation with physical beauty, jealousy and other. Also a look at just how brutal absolute honesty can be.""In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king""-Desiderius ErasmusThe same can be said for the one man who finds that he can lie in the land of truths and will always be believed because no one has heard a lie before.Gervais delivers his wry, dry wit along with a good amount of emotional and philosophical content to be digested. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and while it could have used a bit more of a push now and then it delivered its message and its laughs quite effectively.Very funny, thought provoking and recommended.",1307491200,"06 8, 2011"
"Partly thanks to improvements in film techniques and technology, the producers of Flesh Gordon managed to do an amazing job of duplicating the visual style, fashions and epic scope of the old Flash Gordon serials (which look shoddy by today's standards) on a very tight budget.  For that, this film deserves some recognition.  However, despite the film's accomplishments, its novelty begins to wear thin after the first ten minutes, and then you're just left with poor, sophomoric humour which quickly becomes sleep-inducing.Other ""adult"" movie parodies from this period, such as Al Adamson's adult musical versions of popular fairy tales, at least have moments of unintentional humour that occassionally wake up their viewers when their deliberate attempts at humour fail.  The people who did Flesh Gordon, however, were far too professional in comparison, strictly adhering to a plot and utilizing the best possible production values they could, so unfortunately you mostly get nothing more than their poor script with its unfunny jokes.  Still, its better than the big budget, early 1980s licensed Flash Gordon film with the cheesy Queen soundtrack.",1024617600,"06 21, 2002"

"Cinemania is a fascinating and very funny documentary that focuses on the lives of five New York film-lovers.  The men (and woman) this film chronicles are not simply erudite, artsy types who can appreciate Bergman.  They are people who have literally re-arranged their lives in order to make movie-watching their primary focus.  They are all articulate and funny.  None of them are normal ... they range from strangely overzealous to OCD to downright creepy.  And - while it is frequently hilarious to listen to their testimonies (one cinephile suggested that he's ripped food out of a too-noisy movie-goers hands; another has memorized the precise running time for practically every movie he's ever seen; and another is permanently banned from the MOMA (I'll let you figure out why)), it is also a little sad that these people get more fulfillment from movies than they do from their everyday lives.This documentary excels most when it asks *why* these people need to watch movies (the answers, I think, also speak to the pleasure each of us gets from escapism).  There is a scene where Jack, the main ""character"" in the film, insists that he could only make love to Rita Hayworth in black-in-white.  It's an interesting and telling concept.  Cinemania's greatest weakness is probably its amateurish production qualities.  Rather than come across as quirky and immediate, they are more along the lines of frustrating.  But this is only a minor complaint.  Overall, I would still recommend Cinemania.  I can pretty much guarantee that, if you give it a shot, you'll be entertained and amazed.",1147132800,"05 9, 2006"
A woman fights with her bf on the way to her parent's house for the weekend where she is going to introduce him to the family. He leaves her at a gas station. You keep hearing of this sex offender who has broken out of prison throughout the early part of the movie. Then of course some weird creepy guy shows up at the gas station and pretty much s talks the girl who was left behind. He pretty much forces his help on her. She reluctantly agrees. They drive on downt he road together. One thing leads to another. She ropes him into pretending to be her bf as her family has not seen him. So is he a creep? Isn't he? That is just one of the many questions you are presented with. But it is not really the epicenter of the movie. It is mildly entertaining to me. No real wow moment. If the guy had been anyone other than that gummy looking dude that played the lead character . . . I might have been more interested. Just being honest. But in the end none of these people are people I would befriend or want in my life.

"I was excited when I purchased this DVD in hopes for an addition to my collection that would rival Rodney Yee's awesome Power Yoga DVD. I was greatly disappointed when I actually tried this DVD.I tried both Level 2 & 3 practices, as I wanted to give it a fair shot, but I have to say I was tempted to just turn it off within 5 minutes of beginning it & several times thoughout. But, I stuck with it due to the rave reviews it has received.To be fair, the actual yoga practice is good - it's just too distracting to actually use this DVD due to the excessive talking/preaching from Bryan Kest about the wonders of yoga & the cheesy 80's filming. For me, simple is better when it comes to yoga DVDs - all I need is clear cues, a nicely structured routine, & an instructor to be able to quickly glace at when I need some guidance. Unfortunately, he talks literally NON-STOP the entire practice & it alternates between a classroom setting & ""artistic"" shots of him doing yoga. I would probably do this again & forgive the cheesy filming if it weren't for the talking. I buy fitness DVDs to do on a consistent basis & I don't know how anyone (no matter how much they enjoy the actual practice) can listen to him say the same thing everyday (let alone once through!).

"I love most 30's screwball comedies and I adore Cary Grant, but this one didn't do anything for me.  There are some genuinely funny moments, notably the performance of Dixie Lee, the nightclub singer and the dog, Mr. Smith is terrific...but mostly I found it much less sparkly and snappy than most of this genre.Grant is always wonderful...a true Movie Star of his time....incredibly handsome, very funny, warm and always interesting.  His facial expressions when Dixie Lee performs are almost worth watching the whole film.  I don't much get Irene Dunn, but I guess she was popular at the time.  All of the supporting cast are predictable but entertaining.  If these folks had had a better script the film would have been really good, and perhaps, for the time, it was great.For now, it's good for film students, diehard fans of Grant and Dunn and folks who long for the days of night clubbing in Manhattan.  Screwball comedies are known for their witty dialogue and this didn't have that.  I didn't see that much chemistry between the two leads, either and that's another essential ingredient.  Mostly the plot is predictable from the opening scene and it plods on way too long.  I guess that, in 1937, folks needed to escape from the depression and the longer they could stay in the fantasy world of the theatre, the better.",1228262400,"12 3, 2008"
"I enjoyed this one.  I've seen some losers recently, but this one delivered for the most part.  Tired old plot, perhaps, but on par (I thought) with the  heavyweights in the genre.  The obsessive wannabe holy parents spin is an interesting one, and gives the whole tale a different angle from what I've seen.Also, I don't mean to ruin it (but everyone will know it's coming) the `punishment' handed to the punishers will have you standing in applause.But, the ending...  A gripping, brutal, suspenseful nail biter with a hero and heroine you actually give a **** about can be flawed in one easy step:  in the last two seconds, just give it a standard PG-13 finale shock and you can toss it up on the shelf with the rest...Incidentally,  anyone in the middle of a West Virginian forest who asks ""what congregation y'all with?"" probably won't be happy with your answer...",1219017600,"08 18, 2008"
"Less a `monster' flick, more a `problem solving' drama.  This sci-fi film manages to balance its thrills with an interesting romantic sub-plot.  Director Robert Gordon does a solid job of giving the movie a large-scale feel considering its low budget.  There are a few moments of silliness, which seem to be unavoidable in B-movie productions like this, but these items are easily overlooked by the strength of the bond between the three main characters.  Special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen recreates the Golden Gate Bridge quite convincingly when the huge sea creature attacks San Francisco.  Also, noteworthy is the pro-feminist theme that gives this project substance.  Overall, this movie is better than it had a right to be.  {The blu-ray has a good amount of bonus material.  Also, the black & white as well as the Harryhausen-supervised colorized versions are included.}",1378080000,"09 2, 2013"

I am a big fan of all the previous Underworld installements, but this? Shot more like a video game with all the frentic action sequences & excessive gore factor. Lacking depth even for a popcorn flick. And seriously, they fast forward 12 yrs and all we get is a quick recap and that's suppose to clear everything up. None of the original characters (those whom survived the last time around besides S) are in this movie. Choppy dialogue. So many holes in the plot.

"Possible spoilers.  In 2013, director, writer, cinematographer and jack of all trades, Jeremy Saulnier released a movie called Blue Ruin.  It was about homeless man searching for the killer of his parents.  It was eye-opening for what it wasnt.  From that perspective, this film has the same qualities of surprise.A punk-rock-headbanger band called The Aint Rights has just gotten stiffed at their latest gig and doesnt even have enough gas money to get back home.  For the record, they always seem to have enough money to buy beer and cigarettes however.  The owner of the last bar (David W. Thompson) says he has a cousin up in rural Oregon and he needs a band for one night.  It pays $350 so after syphoning some gas for the van, off they go.I suspect this film will get some additional interest as the late Anton Yelchin (Star Trek reboots) stars as Pat, the guitarist.  Reece (Joe Cole), Sam (Alia Shawkat) and Tiger (Callum Turner) complete the band.  They know up front that the bar is in rural white supremacy territory.  They arrive and are greeted by the manager, Gabe (Malcon Blair who was the lead in the aforementioned Blue Ruin).  He actually seems on the normal side given the bar is filled with neo-Nazis, KKK types and skin-heads of various persuasions.The band is shown to the Green Room which is kind of a staging area or dressing room for guests to wait for their turn on stage.  They play their set, get paid and are about to leave when Pat forgets his phone and goes back to the Green Room to retrieve it.  Opening the door he finds something he wasn't supposed toand the fun begins.  At first I thought this was going to be one of those torture-porn films, but thankfully it isnt.  That doesnt mean there isn't plenty of violence, slashing, hacking, shooting, brutal dog attacks and head bashing.  There is, but it isn't meant to be punishment.  Its just good old cover-up tactics conceived by the head of this particular clan, known as Darcy (Patrick Stewart, Star Trek: Nemisis).  You see, the head skin-head is involved in narco-traffiking and other questionable deeds.  And of course, he wants to keep a low profile for now, so that Obama doesnt come after his guns.So what Saulnier has given us is a taut thriller where the band and one of the female customers played by Emogen Poots are holed up in their small staging room knowing that Darcys goons will soon be knocking at their door.  While this would seem like an easy extraction for Darcy, he has legitimate reasons not to kill them right away, especially with guns.  This makes the bands stand (pun intended) more realistic.  As it is, this is a surprisingly good film with plenty of thrills and chills.  And alas, one of young Anton Yelchins final performances.  Highly recommended.The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Like nearly all modern Blu ray discs, this one looks very good.  Yes, much of the look is a dreary grey or even sepia in coloring but I think that is more a choice of the director for the film itself.  The film doesnt have the sharpness and detail usually seen in Blu ray.  I don't want to make a big deal of this just don't be surprised if the movie looks a little soft.  Overall the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent.  There is plenty of loud music provided by the band (who actually learned the songs they performed) and it is well-dispersed throughout the room.  In some cases the music overwhelms the dialog, which seems especially noticeable when you cant see the actors faces.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Saulnier and a 10 minute featurette called Into the Pit: Making Green Room.",1469836800,"07 30, 2016"

The film is mostly fighting and killing, as in don't get attached to any of the characters.The slow moving zombies are called ""Copperheads"" like the snake except it refers to the fact they worked in the copper mines of Montana, which appears to be the cause, although explanations don't abound on how a remote local outbreak lead to a worldwide disaster.

"I first saw this film at a drive-in theatre in Georgia in 1979. The original pre-release title was to be ""Super Duper Service Station"". I also owned the VHS video release at one time. I never thought it would finally ever be released on DVD!! It stars Kirsten (not Kristen as it says on the front cover of the DVD's sleeve!!) Baker who was later seen as ""Terri"", one of the short-lived summer camp counselors in ""Friday the 13th Part 2"". It co-stars three old familiar faces, Huntz Hall of ""The Bowery Boys"", Joe E. Ross from t.v.'s ""Car 54 Where Are You?"" and Mike Mazurki. The film is fun and pleasant to watch. If you love the old drive-in exploitation films, then I can highly recommend ""Gas Pump Girls"".

Along the way the cabbie and his passenger confront their lives, learn about each other, and reveal their shortcomings. This 90-minute low-budget movie's ambition exceeds its grasp.

"First, the good.  The filmmaker really did a lot with what little (budget wise) he had.  The scenery and setting were really good and he really created a creepy setting out of a vineyard.  In one scene, which reminded me of Creepshow 2 (in a good way) two girls sunbathing by a less than impressive looking lake as approached by a floating mass of vines in a surprisingly frightening moment.  A great shot that made the most out of zero special effects.  But sadly that wasn't enough to save the film.  The concept of killer grapes that turn people in alcoholic zombies just didn't work.  I commend the writers for thinking outside the box, but it just came off as silly.  But the film was never silly enough to be a comedy and never scary enough to be a horror.  The zombies in this film were really not zombies (vampires with green skin would be a better description) and their motivation (drinking the blood of humans in an attempt to get some of the alcohol in their blood) just comes off as contrived.  Also, although there are some surprisingly good actors in this film (Christine Egan, who played the heroine, did a great job) the bad actors sadly overwhelm her.  All in all, it's a good effort, but it falls short.",1434412800,"06 16, 2015"

"THE FIFTH ESTATE is certainly an intriguing piece of work - not least for the fact that it hasn't made up its mind about how view the central character.  Played with narcissistic grace by Benedict Cumberbatch - in one of his best film roles to days - Julian Assange comes across as both obsessive and righteous, impossible to live with yet possessed of firm convictions, haunted by his past yet dedicated to improving the future.  His relationship with Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) is a combustible one; Assange doesn't want his partner around yet can't seem to operate without him.  Eventually the two of them break up for good, and Assange is quite literally hoist by his own hubristic petard.  Structurally speaking. Bill Condon's film is particularly flashy - full of rapid cuts and awkward zooms.  Sometimes it becomes rather irritating in its attempt to stress the central theme; despite Assange's assertions to the contrary, Wikileaks was not a worldwide organization but a two-person operation.  The repeated shots of office desks, peopled by clones of Assange, emphasize the protagonist's ambitious, if somewhat unrealistic, dreams.  Eventually the flashiness gets in the way of the film's resolution, especially at the end, when the shots of burning books and campfires seem especially unnecessary, and Nick Davies' (David Thewlis') concluding speech is nothing short of tendentious.  Nonetheless THE FIFTH ESTATE remains perversely watchable, if only to witness the extreme yet ineffectual reactions of US government officials (played by Stanley Tucci and Laura Linney), once the extent of the leaks becomes evident.",1402358400,"06 10, 2014"

"I'm a pretty big fan of the original Halloween series. At first I thought a remake would be interesting with Rob Zombie as the director, but he totally blew it on both movies, especially this one. It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared.

It starts when Eddie and a co-worker are laid off. When they can't find a job after a couple of weeks the two men decide to open a day-care center for some quick bucks. The two guys in that time aqquire a lot of kids and learn that it's hard to manage children especially when they are on sugar highs or bored. Quickly they recieve complaints from the headmistress at Chapman Academy a pretigious pre-school that dosn't like losing buisness to a fly-by-night to make a quick buck day-care. Quickly a rivarly grows between the two places and when the two Mr. Moms decide they want Daddy Day Care to a permanet establishment all hell breaks loose. But, then the guys get asked to do a job only problem they like what has become of Daddy Day Care and the connection they feel with their kids and the other children. So now the men have to make a career and life choice- daycare or career that offers lots of cash?You can tell that Eddie has chemistry with the kids and he reminded me of how Arnold Swchwangger was with his kiddie cast in ""Kindergarden Cop."" The kids are charming and each of them really sparkles on screen and they are simply adorable in the interviews in the special feature portions of this DVD. I wanted to adopt all of them and take them home with me and I can't wait to see these budding youngsters in upcoming movies. Steve Zahn delievers a studded performance as the Trekkie and he too seemed to have a connection with the kids. I love Steve Zahn and I can only hope to see him in more movies to come. I loved watching this movie to see the real on-screen connections with the children. It's a comedic movie that's not over the top or too drawn out going for a million ridiciolous laughs as possible which you normally see in comedies.With no negative language, offensive behavior, or nudity it's a movie I watch with my kids more than once and is a rare treasure to see. It's an entertaining kiddie comedy. All in all this one of those movies to rent or buy for family movie night!",1112572800,"04 4, 2005"
"What a fresh and surprising performance by DiCaprio, whom I have never favored before, particularly in the blockbuster ""Titanic.""  Here his character Frank evolves and resonates with fragility, bravado, wit and pathos.  Tom Hanks's Carl likewise is no one-dimensional cop, but a fully formed individual whose apparent staleness is deceptive and simultaneously revealing--his work is his life, and yet he expresses care for his duaghter and, ultimately, for Frank.""Catch Me"" entertains on many levels and proves rewatchable--for me a mark of all great films.  Other reviewers have commented that the film is not deep and epic and enduring as are some of Spielberg's other works.  I respond that Carl and Frank developed a unique and believable relationship whose complexity and universality combine to produce subtle import and audience identification surpassing the shallow feel-good wrap-up lesser films pander to their audiences.  The film's true-story aspect played only a minor role for me, as the story was of a boy needing stability and love, and of a man lost to his own family redeeming himself through this particular case.Oh, and don't invite Carl Hanratty to tell jokes at your next party. ""Knock, knock.""Who's there is a compelling story, the truth of which only serves to buttress a well-outfitted period chase film bent on revealing to its audience a pursuit of belonging and identity.  Matt Damon in ""The Bourne Identity"" sought to regain an identity he had lost.  Here DiCaprio and Hanks aim to assemble identities and connections they have never had.This fine film definitely lives a step above the action genre or shallower ""buddy"" ventures.  So (groan) cath it if you can.",1048809600,"03 28, 2003"
"When the subject is someone as out-sized as Errol Flynn -- a certain amount of theatricality is called for, but in this film denied. Even though Robin Hood, Captain Blood, and The Sea Hawk were heroes of mine, and Flynn himself had certain undeniable qualities (humor, charisma, good looks, intelligence, and a certain machismo), in the end Flynn was as corrupt and morally bankrupt as Dorian Gray. With the exception of Sarandon, the actors play their parts with all the intensity of a reality TV show cast -- Fanning is as bland and uninteresting as one might expect a 16 year old to be in the company of more sophisticated adults, Kline portrays Flynn as old and as tired as any ordinary, aging, shop-worn country club Lothario. The problem is Kline and Dakota are too real, too ordinary, too under-sized to be of much interest. Kline's Flynn is neither appallingly grotesque nor charismatic, while Dakota's Beverly Aadland is anybody's willful teen-age daughter. The problem is not with the actors but with the uninspired script, and workmanlike direction. There is conversation, but no dialogue; storms but no lightning. Sarandon alone rises a bit above this and succeeds in giving us a lively character, interesting in her own right despite the material she has to work with. All in all, a talented cast wasted in a plausible but uninspired effort.",1461801600,"04 28, 2016"

"This is one of those movies that is bad but fun to watch anyway. A couple of teenagers and then the local garage owner disappear and it turns out the culprit is a giant lizard that somehow exists for weeks with no one noticing. No explanation is ever given as to where the lizard came from or why or how no one saw something that was big enough to derail a train with its head.There is too much time spent on the main character and his problems and little spent on creating any actual tension with the lizard. The effects are what you would expect, a regular sized lizard walking aimlessly around a miniature set with weird music playing to let you know to be terrified. There are also two interludes where our hero sings. He isn't talented, even though the movie tries to tell you he is. The songs are terrible, have nothing to do with the movie and you will be praying for them to end.The way the lizard is killed in the end is ludicrous, our hero is vindicated and everyone lives happily ever after blissfully ignorant of why their lives were interrupted for a few days by a mutated gila monster.",1131667200,"11 11, 2005"

"I love that there are quite a few good films for young girls to see. Movies with spunk. This one is no exception. It's fresh and funny, and brilliantly acted out. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan do amazing jobs pretending that they are one another, so much so that I actually began to believe that they had switched bodies.Like many mother/daughter's, Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) argue. Anna thinks her mother is ruining her life. Tess thinks she is just watching out for her daughter. They go out for Chinese and a little old Chinese lady gives them each a fortune cookie, which is the catalyst for their switch. Will they ever get back to their own bodies? And more importantly, can they learn to respect one another?Of course this movie is predictable, but that's not the point. It's sweet and a total blast to watch, not to mention laugh out loud funny.The DVD contains some good special features, including alternate endings, which are pretty cool. I have no doubt that teen girls are going to go insane over this film, but men, women, and picky little boys who won't watch anything but Pokemon will like this movie as well.",1076457600,"02 11, 2004"

"Okay, so I didn't see this until I was 24, but scary? God no! Funny, irreverent, and well done, though.Two Americans are wandering along the moors of Wales when they're attacked by a werewolf. Jack (the horny comic relief sidekick) is killed and David (the slightly mature frat boy type) awakens after 6 weeks in a coma in a London hospital, under the care of a hard boiled doc and a sexy nurse.David begins to lose his mind when Jack shows up in sporadic visits, decomposing as he goes along. As a victim of the werewolf Jack is ""undead"" as in dead, but unable to rest, just like all the victims of this werewolf's line.He urges David to kill himself and end the curse, freeing all the victims.David does not and the first night mauls what appears to be an accountant in a Tube station amongst other victims. He wakes up naked in zoo cage with other wolves. He goes back to the nurse's flat and they have wild monkey love.The next night he goes nuts and kills more people, including a clueless couple who are quite amiable when they meet him in the afterlife.The third night undead Jack lures him into a porno theater with the saddest fake prono in the background. David transforms into the ugliest wolf you've ever seen in the theater and after killing everyone in it, escapes into the crowds of Lodnon town. Chased down an alley his only hope for salvation is the quasi-sympathethic London nurse who appears to be using him for sex.Funny, great soundtrack, cool effects, perfect for the horror buff or the comedy buff.

"So these people have a good income, health, looks, children, a great house in a gorgeous community with woods and beaches.  The husband has a job he doesn,t have to work too hard at, and the wife doesn't have to work outside the home at all.  And they are miserable.Why?  Because their privileged lives aren't privileged enough.  They don't just want it all, they want it all and fame too.  Without doing anything interesting to earn it, with no hobbies or passions, or real skills,  they somehow feel like if they just relocate to a magical Paris, they'll become famous -- for what, they don't know.  But they know they deserve that too, and they can't be happy with out it.A more spoiled, stupid set of people, I could not imagine. Had they moved to Paris, they would have soon discovered that changing locations wouldn't change them -- they'd soon be as bored and self destructive in Paris, and probaby a lot poorer and less privileged in Paris, and once the novelty of the location wore off they'd be even more unhappy. Unless actually having to struggle a little woke them up.I watched a little of the commentary and they talked about the lives of quiet desperation, how this was a tragic love story, and I just had to laugh -- it was the only laugh in the movie.  The tragedy is not that these characters were trapped in suburbia -- the tragedy is that they never seemed to understand that life is largely the moments in between the big events in our lives, not the big events themselves. The tragedy is not that these people missed out on their big chance in life to grab more.  The tragedy is that they couldn't make a life with all they had.  And that neither the characters, the actors, or the director had a clue, even after making this ridiculous exercise in self indulgence.This movie might appeal to immature adolescents who are convinced they are owed the universe for no effort on their part and will cry waiting for the universe to deliver. Adults will have very little patience with the theme.",1248825600,"07 29, 2009"

You think they might have remastered or cleaned up the picture for Blu-ray a little? Nope. Everyone agrees this is a great animated tail (er, tale)... but stick with an old DVD (or VHS even!). BTW, the soundtrack is in DTS, but only 2 channel(?!) and EXTREMELY LOUD. Not pleasant to listen or watch.Revised 7/22/16: One note on the widescreen; I just noticed my DVD is viewable in 4:3 ratio by adjusting your TV settings to ""Normal"" from ""Wide"". This is the original intended framing and the best way to watch it. The Blu-ray is ""cropped"" to 1.85:1 ratio with no way to change it.

"I wasn't around when this movie was released, but suspect that 3 hour mega movie was probably viewed as a love letter to the stoic folks at home during WWII. It's premise is so simple that it can be described as the trials and tribulations of the families left behind when the men went off to war in uncertain times and how people adapted to the changing scene at home that seemed to be in constant flux.The story centers around the Hilton family. The father goes off to war while the mother Anne (Claudette Colbert) and her daughters Jane(Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (a teenaged Shirley Temple) deal with the loss of the husband and all the social and economic changes that are brought about by the war. The family regroups on a lot of levels and evolves as they face their own homefront challenges. As the story progresses, the viewer sees an already pretty nice family doing what they can to support the war effort and as a result becoming even better people.While melodramatic and sentimental, it manages to do a lot to convey the feelings of many americans regarding WWII. I fell into the premise of this movie easily because my grandparents talked a lot about the changes they experienced and society as a whole experienced. The cast was really good and very convincing. I particularly liked Joseph Cotten,Robert Walker, Colbert, and Jones in their lead roles while the supporting actors such as Fanny McDaniels, Agnes Moorehead, Nazimova, Keenan Wynn, and Monty Wooley rounded out the casting in their support.This was a movie that echoed the era and came across as a cross between pictures by Norman Rockwell and Currier and Ives.",1314489600,"08 28, 2011"

I thought that it might get better since it has such great reviews.  It never gets better folks, it's just as boring throughout the entire flick. Why is this mandatory to watch in school?

"Documentaries of real Poltergeists and Hauntings, don't want it. Yeah, we get a full featured ""Real World of Poltergeists"" included with this special edition, but who is Warner Brothers kidding here? This is not Unsolved Mysteries, this is a classic movie. Where is the making? Where is the story of the poltergiest curse which includes death of cast members and some poeple in involed with the movie? Where is the story of Heather O Rourke's sudden death? Where is the controverisal heated story between the director Tobe Hooper and producer Spielberg?  You're not going to get anything about it. No cast interviews, no storylines about the movie's infancy,  nothing about the making of the movie, just another decent documentary about hauntings and poltergesits and contacting the dead which has nothing to do with the movie itself. In all seriousness, there is nothing wrong with the documentary included with the film, but it just doesn't belong here.As for the movie itself, we know how awesome it is, and yes, it does look like it's been cleaned up quite a bit. Boasting it being digitally restored and remastered it probably true. It's defintely the best looking poltergeist I've ever seen on my TV. The audio even seemed to get an upgrade too. As fans know, this came out 25 years ago in 1982, wow, has it been that long, but amazingly, it has still withstood the test of time as is still considered to be one of the best movies ever made. I personally believe the movie is Spielberg's best, more than E.T., Close Encounters, you name it, Poltergeist is probalby his best work. While Tobe Hooper takes credit for being the director, that's where the controversy starts between Hooper and Spielberg. And I can honestly that's why WB has ignored a full fledged making of the movie knowing the controversy it may spawn between Hooper and Spielberg. But even without the interviews or making of the movie, if you haven't bought this movie yet, now is probably a good time, just don't expect any good extras that have anything to do with the movie.",1199145600,"01 1, 2008"

The CG isn't horrible like Panzer Dragoon, but I can tell these guys weren't taking notes on the CG in Cowboy Bebop or Blue Sub No. 6. Even the 2D animation is horrible. And then theres the story. The story goes fairly well until the ending. This is the worst ending I have ever scene in an anime and I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave Sin 2 stars instead of one is for the dub, which brilliantly done, but doesn't make up for the laging story and bad animation.

"A few weeks ago I had the astounding honor of fulfilling one of my lifelong goals; I met Roger Ebert.Me and my co-directing friend went to the Savannah Film festival with big cheezy grins on our faces. We were going to have a once in a lifetime opportunity to go through a shot-by-shot question and answer session with Roger Ebert. That in itself was incredible, and more than enough to keep this Alabama boy happy the rest of his days. I have spent the last decade reading his reviews, along with millions of other folks every week. He is arguably the number one personal source of information on Citizen Kane. So respected in fact, he was given the task to have an informative commentary track on the disk, which any fan of the film should listen to.We had to throw around a few bargains, but finally we krept our way to the front row. In front of me, the stool in which he was going to sit on. Most excellent, right? Wrong, that's nothing - just the beginning. Behind me, a voice was heard amongst the others in the packed theater. ""Thats where he sat last night."" To my amazement he was pointing to the chair directly beside me. I choked as they brought in a microphone and placed it in front of the seat to my right. I was going to watch what the American Film Institute calls ""the greatest movie of all time"", with one of the most respected Critics of all time.Sure enough, he came in and gave a brief bow. ""Peter O' Toole was here wednesday, and let me tell you, he is a pro at taking applause. First he gracefully entered bowing then, once he had sat down, he noticed the balcony, so he stood once more with a surprised expression on his face as if he didn't deserve it. He is the master."" Likewise he did so to the balcony.Ebert was very nice, and if he were to stop reviewing, he would have no trouble finding work as a stand-up comedian. Popping the Citizen Kane disk out and placing it in the player, he kept the crowd rolling with anecdotes. Anything from why watching weekly citcoms is a sin, to the absurdity of yearly sports. He is anti-cycle. ""Watching three episodes of Seinfield is a good thing. Watching every episode of seinfield is a waste of life. Watch a movie, listen to music, have a picnic, make love to your spouse... anything!""Ofcourse there were some unhappy groans, but hey, he was honest and unpolitically correct, which anyone should give him credit for. Finally, ""Lets get the movie going.""He sat down beside me. There was a brief exchange of nods as the lights went down. The rules to the question and answer session is, as the movie rolls if you have a comment or question you yell out ""STOP!"" And so he does, then the question is asked.I was able to decifer some of the unintelligable questions for Ebert, because it was a packed house and some of the voices were very faint. One person caused a laughing riot when he compared the little monkey dolls in the wife's room with the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz; As if there was some intentional link between them. Ebert replied, ""That is something you have to decide between you and your conspirator."" The voice lashed out, ""In this case, that would be you!"" ""Uh oh,"" Ebert laughed to himself.There were many facts unearthed during the session. Some that even he, after over a hundred viewings, hadn't realized. Such as ""the ranch"" mentioned earlier in the film held the same name as the bar his wife is drinking in during her talk with the newspaper man. Also shot in which main characters are seen as the camera pulls back through a window. A hand is barely seen removing a chair from the way of the camera. Very neat information for fans. These discoveries led to applause towards the discovering audience members. Later these were put in his own essay about the festival.""The sled in the film was purchased at auction by Steven Spielberg."" I was shocked. I leaned over to him, ""I was the one who sent you the e-mail about that when it happened."" He was surprised, ""Really?"" Then he want back to the Q and A. I supposed he was just humoring me, because he is no doubt use to the crazies out there. So I left it at that.Once the film ended and he had said his last words, the crowd stood up and raced towards him. To my surprise, he walked over to me, ""So, you sent me that e-mail?"" He really remembered. Out of all of the thousands of e-mails, he plucked from his memory, my letter. ""Yes sir,"" I said. ""Wow, and I replied right?"" he asked. ""Yes, you said 'thanks for the information'. That 'news about the sled interested you greatly'.""I knew the people standing around us were growing angry, but we continued to talk. After all was said and done, my friend and I received autograph's and a picture which you can see at hideawayfilms dot com. He gave us almost all the time he had, and for all of these things I am extremely grateful. I know it took an act of God to bring all of this together so perfectly, and to him I am forever in debt.Watching Citizen Kane was an incredible experience that everyone should take part in atleast once. If you don't like it, that's fine, you know my opinion. Give the commentary a shot, it's a wealth of information that will help in your pursuit for film knowledge. Kane is the standard by which many filmakers, including myself, have set for themselves. It is a good measure.  ~S.A.O.S.~",1100822400,"11 19, 2004"

"So it looks like the gang from American Pie is back for another round!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So Jim and Michelle are having marital problems, sex has become something that they don't do often because they have careers and a child that take up most of their time.  Oz is a sports announcer guy that is on an ESPN knock off, Stiffler is a temp working for some financial firm, Kevin is a stay at home husband, and Finch is traveling the world, or so he says, but he's really an assistant manager of a Staples in New Jersey.We get the usual gags of Stiffler doing crazy things, Jim ending up in crazy situations that he has to explain himself out of and ends up having to make a big emotional heartfelt speech in order to get out of.We also find out that Oz only wants to get back with the girl he fell in love with back in high school.  Kevin just wants to remain friends with Vicki, his first love, Stiffler just wants to keep partying and getting laid, Finch just wants people to think he is cool and find true love.Of course we get the obligatory topless scenes and we also have a scene where we see Jim's junk, which I could have done without.Also we get lots of cameos from our old favorites, Nadia, the Shermanator, Stiffler's mom, Jessica, and the MILF guys are back as well.  They all come together and make us laugh and make us remember how much fun we had with these movies back when they were just a trilogy and something that defined our teenage and college years.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Anyone who enjoyed watching the American Pie movies will enjoy watching this latest installment of the franchise and will be reminded of the good times we had back in the late ninety's and the early 2000's.

Too boring.,1481241600,"12 9, 2016"
"A friend recommended ""Memento"" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers. However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see ""The Usual Suspects.""""Memento"" is unmomentous for the same reason ""The Usual Suspects"" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching ""The Usual Suspects"" about 3/4 into the movie.""It was just, frankly, boring,"" I told my friend. ""I lost interest.""My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.So, I went into ""Memento"" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.The problem with ""Memento"" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than ""Memento,"" and no, I'm not forgetting ""Johnny Stool Pidgeon"" or ""Detour"" either. As far as ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Out of the Past"" or ""White Heat,"" forget about it! ""Memento"" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.Watching movies requires, as we all know, the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as ""Dodgeball"" and ""Mr. 3000."" When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for ""American Beauty.""Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:PEARCE: I need this tatooed.TATOO GUY: What does it say?PEARCE: ""He has a gun, and he's coming for you.""TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look ""killer cool."" Use this CD cover as an example for your fonts.TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's ""Sacrifice."" Lots of cool Goth script.PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said ""image is everything,"" so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller ""Mirage"" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.He *acts* .",1101168000,"11 23, 2004"

"Only knew a little about this movie from trailer on TV and Washington being nominated for award(s) for his acting. I found it so-so. Other than exciting in beginning, mostly is a drama about alcoholism, which is not a bad story but I am not sure I needed to see or ""feel"". I do not know, perhaps other movies have dealt with the subject or perhaps not. I guess it is an important topic to address and Washington being an airline captain puts emphasis on the danger. So in the end, not an action movie or love story, a drama, slow prodding drama that is predictable. Would I watch again? NO. Oh, and Washington for an acting award?

"The summer 2009 adventure family film ""Aliens in the Attic"" will entertain you with it's kid-friendly comedy, not so much reliance on the grownups and a film that manages to capture  the time of youth and adventure.  The film has made over $56 million worldwide and now its set for a release on Blu-ray and DVD.The film is directed by John Schultz (""Bandwagon"", ""The Honeymooners"") and features a screenplay by Mark Burton (""Madagascar"", ""Chicken Run"", ""Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"") and Adam F. Goldberg (""Still Standing"", ""Aliens in America"", ""Fanboys"").  The film features music by composer John Debney (""Hannah Montana: The Movie"", ""Swing Vote"", ""Evan Almighty"") and a screenplay by Don Burgess (""Enchanted"", ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"", ""The Polar Express"", ""13 Going on 30').""Aliens in the Attic"" revolves around the Pearson family.  Tom Pearson (played by Carter Jenkins, ""Viva Laughlin"", ""Surface"", ""Bad News Bears"") is an intelligent person who is great a computers and a hacker.  On the day that his parents Stuart (played by Kevin Nealon, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Weeds"", ""Grandma's Boy"") and Nina (played by Gillian Vigman, ""The Job"", ""The Hangover"", ""Sons & Daughters"") were checking up on his grades online, they noticed that his grades were changing.Meanwhile, Tom's sister Bethany (played by Ashley Tisdale, ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"", ""High School Musical"", ""Phineas and Ferb"") tries to sneak in through his bedroom window after her big date with her boyfriend Ricky Dillman (played by Robert Hoffman, ""Step Up 2: The streets"", ""The Onion Movie"") who Tom can't stand.  While his little sister Hannah (played by Ashley Boettcher) tries to warn them that their father is upset and coming to see him, Stuart tells Tom that he needs to stay away from his computer, do better in school and he will have to go on the family trip for a day of fishing and staying at home that they leased for the summer.While the Pearson family made it to the home that they are staying, they are greeted by Stuart's mother Nana (played by Doris Roberts, ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), his brother Nathan (played by Andy Richter, ""The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien Show"") and his children Jake (played by Austin Robert Butler, ""Ruby & the Rockits"") and the video game playing twins Art and Lee Pearson (played by Henri and Regan Young).For the two families to meet each other again for this vacation, its apparent that Tom and Jake don't quite get along as Jake is younger but more dominant and tougher than Tom.  And to make things worse for Tom, Bethany's boyfriend Ricky has also schemed his way into being a guest at the home.  Jake convinces Tom to take action against Ricky and use his paintball gun to get him to leave the premises.  But of course, it all backfires and Tom's parents feel bad for him and Tom gets another lecture.As the whole family try to enjoy their vacation, because the TV stopped working, Ricky volunteers to fix the satellite but wants Tom to join him upstairs.  Meanwhile, we see a spaceship(s) arrive on top of the house.While upstairs, Ricky tells Tom that he is lying about his intentions of coming to their house and that he is also not a high school student but a man no longer in school.  And to get back at Tom for the paintball incident, Ricky forces Tom to fix the satellite himself.  And as Tom check on the satellite, he sees that the dish has been destroyed.  Jake joins Tom on the roof and is surprised about the damage caused to the dish but then things go crazy as a shadow of some creature shows up on the wall.  As they turn around, they are greeted by four mean aliens: The leader Skip, the warrior Tazer, the intelligent engineer named Sparks and a female named Razor who want to capture both Tom and JakeAs Ricky, tries to talk to Tom, not knowing there are aliens behind him, he is shot by a dart on the back of the neck and is now being controlled by the robots.Meanwhile, all children come in contact with the aliens and now the war is on.  Aliens work up a strategy to get to the basement in order to find a device that will call down its alien fleet to attack the Earth, while the children do what they can to prevent it from happening.Will the kids be able to stop the aliens in time?""Aliens in the Attic"" on Blu-ray comes with two discs, the original Blu-ray with the film and the special features and a second disc which contains a digital copy of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Aliens in the Attic"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1, AVC@22MBPS).  With a good number of scenes are shot during the day, the colors are vibrant and even indoors, inside the house there is good enough lighting that you do see the detail in the homes, destruction caused by the children and the aliens.Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital) and this is where ""Aliens in the Attic"" shines.  Dialogue and music is front and center channel driven but it's the good amount of LFE that you hear during the action sequences that catch your attention.  Especially at the end when you hear the stomps with that deep bass coming out of your subwoofer, almost reminiscent of that ""Jurassic Park"" T-Rex stomping, a good amount of that during the action sequence at the end.  Especially during the implosion of a machine where you hear this long reverberating sound that sounds really nice.  I didn't hear any major use of panning or any significant surround usage, especially with the rear surrounds but for the most part, for a kid-friendly film, good use of lossless audio during the action sequences.Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Aliens in the Attic"" comes with the following special features:  * Introduction to Film with Ashley Tisdale - (:20) Introduction shown beginning of the presentation of the film and also included in the special features.  * Introduction to Special Features with Ashley Tisdale - (:20) An introduction to the special features by Ashley Tisdale.  * Alternate Ending - (2:46) An alternate ending but not yet finalized with the special effects and CG animation.

Personally, I think that there are going to be a lot of children films that touch upon fantasy and once in awhile, it's good to have these type of films where the parents are not too important to the plot but it's the children working together to take on the enemy.  Personally for me, it reminds me of the zaniness of a film such as ""The Goonies"" but for a more younger demographic that know their video games, know who Ashley Tisdale is and for adults, a film to just watch and enjoy without having to critique how the CG doesn't compare to the latest Pixar film or how this film did not screen for critics.The kids bring some charm to the film.  You have Carter Jenkins playing the very intelligent Tom Pearson, but in the beginning, tries to shave off his ""book smarts"" because it's not cool and in the end, I personally though the message with his character was quite positive for children.  Being smart doesn't mean you're not cool.  Austin Robert Butler as Jake Pearson, the child who thinks combat/strategy is a predictable gung-ho character (especially when he owns an expensive paint ball machine gun, you know where that's going).  For the video game fans, the twins Henri and Regan young reaches out to those who know their video games.  From one sporting the old school Activision shirt, to them using their video game skills during the body control parts of the film.  And dare I say, I had fun seeing the ""Street Fighter 2' Shoryuuken and spinning kick move that the kids use on Doris Roberts character Nana.  And Ashley Boettcher as the young Hannah Pearson who is the cute innocent young girl who befriends an alien, ala young Drew Barrymore who played Gertie on ""E.T."".Ashley Tisdale provides that young star power for those who are familiar with her Disney Channel TV shows or her films and also her music.  But the shining star happens to be her boyfriend Robert Hoffman, who portrays the craziest role when he gets controlled by the aliens and later on by the kids.As mentioned earlier, the adults do not play a major role in this film.  Sure, we have former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members Kevin Nealon and Tim Meadows and ""Late Show with Conan O'Brien"" sidekick Andy Richter and also actress Gillian Vigman.  But the adults do not really interfere in the film but you do get to see ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" actress Doris Roberts as the grandmother Nana Rose Pearson being mind controlled and the video game twins use her a fighting video game-like character.  Sure, it's corny but for fighting video game fans who recognize the fighting moves, you can't help but laugh and root for grandma.But the hijinks are hilarious, the characters are fun and my son enjoyed the film as well.  Personally, I figured that I grew up with such 80's films as ""E.T."", ""The Goonies"", ""The Monster Squad"", where kids work together to take on an enemy.  Sure, we have that now with a few adventure films but it's good to have something different (especially when its aliens) and a film that is not so serious.As for the Blu-ray, personally, I enjoyed the Blu-ray release.  I thought the picture quality was good and the audio quality especially the utilization of LFE (especially at the end) was a nice tough for the audiophiles. And for the Ashley Tisdale fans, there are a good number of special features for you.Parents who are wondering if this is suitable for children, I think four years and older would be fine.  It's not a scary film at all but perhaps the sight of green aliens with sharp teeth may be a bit scary for them.  But for the most part, this is a kid friendly film.Overall, ""Aliens in the Attic"" is not as adventurous as ""The Goonies"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", emotional as ""E.T"" or dark as ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" but the film does well for its own as a kid-friendly film with a fun group of young characters trying to fight off four aliens who are trying to trigger an alien invasion.""Aliens in the Attic"" is an enjoyable family film that is fun, hilarious and entertaining, especially if not taken too seriously.  Overall, a  film definitely worth giving a try!",1257292800,"11 4, 2009"
"The Wall the movie sure was a strange experience!  What is the movie exactly?  It's basically a bunch of scenes attached together that fit together with the music from the Pink Floyd album.  In other words, while the music is playing from the Wall album, you can see the lyrics from the songs matched together with the scenes on the screen.  Most of the scenes involve a little school boy who appears lost and confused when it comes to family and school.My favorite scene is the same one MANY people who currently hate, or have hated in the past, the dreadfully LONG hours (and days) of going to school and learning.  Man, it really stinks to be a kid and have to do the same old routine day in and day out as far as learning and classroom assignments are concerned.  In the movie, you get to see what going to school is like through a childs eyes, and how boring it can be.Also, another highlight of the film was all the incredibly diverse and creative animation that fit in well with the music.  A colorful tale and vision that was beautiful in every sense.  It almost looks like an amazing drug trip.  You truly have to see it to know what I mean.  Worth watching!",1207958400,"04 12, 2008"

"The Spartans is actually three separate documentaries, which attempt to bring to life the legendary heroes of Lacedaemon.On the positive side:  1) Shot on location, Bettany Hughes does a good job of presenting the actual setting for the events that unfolded.2) She presents the Battle at Sphacteria of 425 BC, the Syracuse expedition of 415 BC, and the involvement of Alcibiades very well and very accurately.3) The re-enactment of the hoplite phalanx throughout the documentaries added a nice touch.4) The theme is Sparta after all; that in itself is a positive aspect!On the negative side:1) She does not mention half as much as she should about THE most heroic battle in world history; the Battle at Thermopylae; a three day battle (August 18th, 480 BC through August 20th, 480 BC) for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates) between an immense Persian host under King Xerxes and a small Greek force led by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans.  Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand, and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, theSpartans and Thespians willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against overwhelming odds.  When told that the Persian arrows would block out the sun, they replied 'Good, we will fight in the shade!'2) Bettany Hughes mentions homosexual relationships between men, when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece, and especially in Sparta, was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial; therefore, calling for EXTREME CAUTION when dealing with such matters.  She even goes as far as to proclaim that it was compulsory!  What people do in their own bedrooms is their own business, but to involve Greece's great men and legends in alleged homosexual acts, shows complete lack of respect as well as lack of basic/elementary knowledge of the era in question, with most frequent the misinterpretation of love between friends which did not include anything sexual or homosexual whatsoever!  The warrior-heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.3) Moreover, there are so many stories relating to the honor and glory of the Spartan hoplites, which are left unsaid; instead only a few and mediocre at that were mentioned.  What ever happened to:i) The reason why they wore red cloaks.ii) The reason why they had two kings and the names of the Royal Houses i.e. The Agiads and the Eurypontids.iii) The story with the boy and the fox that ate its way through his stomach, but he did not cringe.iv) The story of the stranger who asked the Spartans what happened to adulterers in Sparta, only to be told that they would have to pay as compensation a bull big enough to stand on Mount Taygetus and drink from the river Eurotas, meaning that there are no adulterers in Sparta.v) The story of the mother who killed her son for having been hit with an arrow in the back (i.e. having turned his back to the enemy).vi) The story of the mother who upon seeing her son's friend asked how the battle had gone and when her son's friend replied that her child had died, she told him that was not what she had asked; her question was whether Sparta had been victorious.vii) The Queen of Sparta Gorgo, (and wife to King Leonidas) who when asked by a foreign woman 'how is it that Spartan women are the only ones who rule men?' she answered: 'Yes, for we are the only ones who give birth to men.'viii) How in Sparta only men who died on the battlefield and women who died during, or shortly after, giving birth were entitled to having a tombstone erected in their honor.ix) Pausanias' words following the Battle of Platae of 479 BC as to why his Spartans were eating Melas Zomos (the broth) instead of feasting like the rest of the Greeks, 'We are Spartans.'x) Pausanias' fate after setting up a monument in the Hellespont commemorating the victory over the Persians.4) In addition she does tend to go off and talk about the other city-states more than she should when the theme is Sparta and not Greece as whole.Nevertheless, The Spartans will bring out interest in the famed inhabitants of Lacedaemon, and hopefully more books, movies, and documentaries will present these heroes (both men and women) with the reverence and respect they truly deserve.Strongly recommended is the 1962 film The 300 Spartans; a movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Greece and Freedom.",1151539200,"06 29, 2006"
"This is not a typical movie. Most movies made nowadays seem to be content to merely photograph what is happening, not caring to a great degree about the use of color and the placement of objects and people on the screen (you know, cinematography). Well, that problem is definitely not to be found in this movie. Truly it must be watched over and over again to fully grasp all the subtle hints being tossed your way by the director. For instance, in Unbreakable green symbolizes good, and purple and orange symbolize evil. So throughout the movie, you might want to keep an eye on the color of the environments, and the colors that different people wear. Many of the scenes with Mr. Glass start by us seeing him through a reflection of through a glass window. And then there's the whole comic book aspect of the movie. If you look at the entire movie as one issue of a comic book, the angles used, the use of lighting, and the things said by characters all take on a whole new meaning. I have seen this movie 4 times so far, and I'm sure I'm still missing a lot of the movie. For people who love a good story, a different twist on traditional movie-making, great cinematography, or just a good old comic-book movie, this is a must see. Or if you're a hard-core film fan, a must-buy.",1034121600,"10 9, 2002"

The series is a bit mild with the love scenes, I guess it's a little too ""G"" rated for me, but there's some skin, so maybe PG rated, which I am sure is a good thing for many people, so I wouldn't say it's a negative, but I just love the actor that plays Uhtred, be still my heart...",1449878400,"12 12, 2015"

"This movie Terminator 2 is for sure a classic and now 20 years old might still be the greatest sci fi movie ever made.  The action and suspense is incredible along with of course the sci fi effects.  By far still my favorite Terminator movie of the franchise and just seems like the movie never gets old.  I remember seeing it when it first came out in the early 90's saying was the greatest thing on TV I ever saw, and at the time for me it was.  You can see it played often on the basic cable channels and on some premium movie channels as well.  Unless you have been very busy or don't watch much tv and have not seen this movie be sure to do so and you will not regret it.Peter J. Miller",1320624000,"11 7, 2011"
"I'll admit I enjoyed a lot of what I saw, but I have to drop this movie down quite a lot from it's predecessor. I said that movie had problems as a remake but was ok as a movie. Here it's got problems as a movie and as part of the series it wasn't good.First, what I enjoyed, I enjoyed the dark tone and the newness of the storyline. Also many of the arguments are actually close to real life arguments we may experience during our lifetimes. The deaths were gruesome, the film got tense as it went on and there was a general sense of helplessness/negativity that I usually don't like, but felt was good in this movie.Now for the problems, this really isn't Halloween II. This is PTSD for everyone involved in the first and Michael just happens to show up at the end of the movie. Loomis went back to talk but little action and seemed very different from the previous movie. Trying to feel for Laurie was almost impossible even though I think that was the point. Michael having visions doesn't make sense as he didn't seem to have them before. Even though it's the best acted scene of the movie, I hated one perticuler characters death (you can figure it out).Finally neither ending was done well. SPOILER ALERT PEOPLE SO YOU MAY WANT TO STOP. In both endings it's obvious Laurie is not a threat and yet she gets shot anyway. Also in the alternate ending Michael talking was a bad move. Finally, it's appearent that the film wants to indicate the ""evil"" has passed onto Laurie but why kill her/put her in the white room? Maybe watching special features will explain that, I dunno.So I do like a lot of this movie, but three stars is what this movie has to get.",1393545600,"02 28, 2014"
"This movie, I also, did not know existed until 2 weeks ago. This one is actually better than Slap Shot 2. Which is weird to say. This one has zilch to do with the original, other than alluding to the original team and name. One of the best parts of the movie is having 2 ex-NHL players in it. Mark Messier may have a really small part, but if you watch the kid clutching his arm in the announcers booth and the see the look on his face it is priceless and worth the $3.75 I paid for this one. The goalie on the opposing team called the Ice Hounds, you know is going to get his spoiled ass kicked and sure enough he does and that is satisfying in itself. Whoever is behind the mask is actually a very talented goalie, and the kid playing the part does a good job of being a total creep who lacks any humbleness of a real hockey player. Oh and the Hanson brothers are back and this time they each have a kid whom they have taught their ways. They do a pretty good job of being bruisers like their dads were. The Ice Hounds, also, recruit players that belong being locked up, just like the original movie and that is about it for resembling a Slap Shot movie. If you can get this for what I paid or less and have 90 minutes to kill this one okay and better than Slap Shot 2. That said nothing is better than the original, of course.",1400457600,"05 19, 2014"

"Overall, a good movie that features some interesting history on the Hoover's ""G-men"" and crime in the 1930's during the Great Depression.  However, it missed the mark in telling and showing a captivating story, which is unfortunate.This isn't a family or date movie, unless you're into violence and lots of gun fire and dead bodies.The story follows the infamous bank robber John Dillinger and his gang through numerous bank jobs and escapes from lock-up. In contrast, the story also follows Hoover and his recruitment of a the new head of the Chicago FBI office, as they tighten the net on Dillinger.Obviously a great cast, set design, and wardrobe. Action scenes could have been better. Where this movie fell flat, is in the story. I wasn't captivated by either of the story's main characters. Sure, okay, they were interesting. But I wasn't drawn into their lives, like I should have been, especially with a story that has at its side, such rich history to pull from.And I'm not sure, how the directing pulled me into the story or characters either.Other then the historical aspect, I'm not sure I would buy this movie for my collection.",1331078400,"03 7, 2012"
"The performances by Gobbi and Bechi are so outstanding that seeing them  should make opera lovers of anyone not already mad about opera. They have great voices, young, strong, and with brilliant technique.  Their intelligent acting is a lesson for everyone.  Then, as two other reviewers have said, Schipa, at age 70, gives another lesson in use of control of feeling, meaning. tone and diction. (I bought this film to follow Scipa's late career.)As for the film, there is 20 year old Gina Lollobrigida to make us ask what she did at 70. The silly story and mugging actors have the faults and the virtues that other reviewers emphasize, and may demonstrate the influence of Hollywood.. I didn't mind one time through, and I am able to jump to the music now. I'm so grateful for the very rare opera content that i urge everyone to buy the DVDThe picture and sound are surprisingly good, I think,and  the Bel Canto Society says it worked for the best.",1452729600,"01 14, 2016"
"Rarely indeed does a movie come along that is so incompetently made, so poorly shot, so ill-thought-out, so ineptly acted, so amateurishly edited, and so embarrassingly awful on all levels that you know, in the midst of the awful suffering of actually watching it, that you're seeing something most people will never experience in their entire lives.  Paranormal Retreat is one such movie.  I have to believe that there must have been some kind of inhumanly dark and brilliant mind that created this because no film could actually be this bad accidentally.  You know how they say that a monkey with a typewriter might theoretically pound out the works of Shakespeare at some point over the course of infinity?  Well, theres even less of a chance that a movie this bad could just blossom into being randomly.The setup for the film is more well-known than a one dollar hooker at a Shriners convention  paranormal research team investigates a haunted location.  Its supposed to be some old farmhouse, but the place looks pretty modern to me  I know the barn is certainly made of metal.  Anyway, lots of goofy, inane banter ensues as the team eventually finds the actual location.  Its never clear to me whether they are believers or debunkers, but that really doesnt matter.  Weird things start happening almost immediately  especially involving contact with locals (especially a grumpy farmer) who weren't supposed to be there.  Then the ghosts begin to make their presence known.  Its a funny thing about these ghosts  although the characters apparently cant see them, the viewer can plainly see people walking and crawling around doing things.  Maybe I was supposed to pretend that I couldn't see the people?  The filmmakers apparently thought that shooting these ghosts with low-quality cameras in poorly lit conditions make them seem invisible or something.  Who knows what these folks were thinking?  You literally cant see what is going on for at least half of the movie  no one could hold a camera steady.I could go on and on bashing this film, but I think Ive made my point.  These guys didn't even edit out the parts where actors could be heard laughing off-camera at the end of a couple of scenes.  Lets be clear about one thing, though  this is not one of those so bad they're good bad movies.  Paranormal Retreat is a so bad you cant believe how incredibly bad it is bad movie.",1434672000,"06 19, 2015"

The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the ""undelivered package,"" which really means nothing held it together.  Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they ""like"" it will show it to you for free.

"""Smart Money"" is a strange movie, to say the least. It was made right after Edward G Robinson's breakout performance as Rico in ""Little Caesar"" (The G was for Goldenberg, his real name), and Warner Brothers was anxious to spin off another crime film with Robinson asap. But Robinson was not at all like Rico nor was he interested in making a career as a tough guy, so he demanded changes in the script of ""Smart Money"" to soften his image. The result is a script that shows Nick the Barber (Robinson's character) alternately being sweet and sour, friendly and psychopathic. Robinson occasionally falls into the ""Yeah, that's right sister"" accent that he used so forcefully in ""Little Caesar"" but then reverts to a caring sweet small town barber.Robinson's character is not the only strange part of this film. Early on a woman comes to him and whispers in his ear and Nick hands her $100 bill (making one wonder how a small town barber has a $100 bill in his wallet). She walks up the street and hands the bill to Boris Karloff (an uncredited role even though he speaks several lines) who is lurking in the shadows (where else?), and then Karloff shows up in the back room of the barber shop where Nick and his friends are playing craps.  Nick recognizes the $100 bill, forces Karloff to bet the entire sum, and then kicks him out when he loses. The two scenes make no sense and suggest that several more scenes were cut, which is possible when you consider ""Smart Money"" runs longer than ""Little Caesar"".If these features aren't strange enough, we have Jimmy Cagney playing a supporting role. Cagney shot ""Smart Money"" while he was shooting ""Public Enemy"" and often had to run between the two sets (both were produced at Warners). Once ""Public Enemy"" came out, a few months after ""Smart Money"" debuted, Cagney became a major star and would never appear as a supporting actor again. In fact, even while ""Smart Money"" was being made, the studio knew that Cagney was going to be a huge hit, so they enlarged his part, but they didn't do it seamlessly, so Cagney seems to pop in and out of the film.BTW - the guy who helps Cagney hold up the poker game is Donald Cook, the actor who played Cagney's brother, Mike Powers, in ""Public Enemy"". Cook's role goes uncredited.As a historical film, we have Edward G Robinson, James Cagney, and Boris Karloff at the very starts of their careers (""Frankenstein"" would be released about the same time as ""Public Enemy""), all together in the same scene. Other than this, however, the film tends to be tedious. The ""kinder, gentler"" gangster film unless supporting a comedy usually falls flat, and given such contemporaneous films as ""Scarface"", ""Little Caesar"", and ""Public Enemy"", ""Smart Money"" has tended to be ignored.",1266364800,"02 17, 2010"

"So here I am once again singing the praises of Shout Factory--and for good reason. They've managed to do in three months what Sony could not do in nearly six years--release two consecutive seasons of ""Hazel"" on DVD.Obviously there IS a market for this 50-year-old TV show when Season 3 is announced weeks before Season 2 hits stores.Here are the 32 episodes included on this set:Pot Luck A La Mode (9/19/1963)An Example For Hazel (9/26/1963)Dorothy Takes A Trip (10/3/1963)You Ain't Fully Dressed Without A Smile (10/10/1963)Cheerin' Up Mr. B.

Also, one episode titled ""The Campaign Manager"" on Disc Four is the syndicated cut version which only runs 22 minutes. These factors are what prevent this from being a Five-Star release IMO.The Season-premiere features a different opening with the cast preparing for Hazel to take a family portrait; the last episode of the season features yet another alternate opening with Harold pretending to be a toll-booth operator as Hazel is seated in a bright-red Ford convertible. The remainder of the episodes feature the opening with everyone piling into the car with Hazel smiling behind the wheel. Purists will be glad to know the original Screen Gems ""dancing sticks"" logo appears at the end of the closing credits.At this rate, we may see the remaining two seasons out by the end of 2012 or early 2013. I certainly hope so, while Season 5 wasn't the best, it features a teenage Ann Jillian as a semi-regular and I rarely saw many of those episodes in syndication.

I thought to myself that non-readers would be confused here, and my assumption was confirmed by some people I've heard from who hadn't read the series.

"The basic storyline is an alien female drives a van through Scotland seducing men.The film opening has a faint muffled voice. It is the alien being learning to speak. What appears to be an alien comes to Scotland and tricks men into coming into her world where they can't walk on water. I wasn't sure if this was real science fiction or something like that Jake Gyllenhaal thing and this was just another metaphor for human relations...which it still could have been. The film changes direction about midway.Scarlett plays an almost robotic alien, very slow and deliberate in her moves. She doesn't know how to respond to many situations. She asks for directions as if she was reading from a foreign phrase manual. As far as Sci-Fi goes in this genre I think ""Phantasm"" was more entertaining and ""Liquid Sky"" more clever.Her acting was well done, but as far as entertaining, if left something to be desired.

Bad guys hit a girl, girl tries to escape, girl in recaught and hit again and daughter and dad find obstacle, surpass it, find obstacle, surpass it. And, none of these obstacles are fun or exciting to watch.I'm going to stop now because I don't want to go on and on. That was the problem of The Missing.",1078272000,"03 3, 2004"

"The pacing of this movie, and in fact the whole Hobbit trilogy, is really bad, which upsets the storytelling so profoundly that it is near unwatchable.  I've never known a movie with so much action and cinematography to be so outright boring.  So how could a film by Peter Jackson, who is attributed to the Lord of the Rings films, fall so far from grace?  Well to be blunt, he and the rest of the production team sold out.Consider this--The Lord of the Rings movies, which are masterpieces, had three installments based on three books--one a piece.  The Hobbit is only one book, and markedly shorter than any of the LotR novels, yet it spans three films.  How is this possible?  To extend the life of the franchise, Jackson blatantly re-wrote whole parts of the story to implant characters who should not appear in the Hobbit, make unnecessary and unscrupulous tie-ins to the LotR movies, and fabricate entirely new characters and events that do not exist within the Tolkien mythology.  All this was done for the sole purpose of generating more movies and more sales with little regard for storytelling and the viewers' actual enjoyment.  It's blatant corporate greed and it should not be supported.The producers really took advantage of the fans.  The people behind the scenes knew they had a strong lure from the LotR franchise and could trust people to come out in droves to see the Hobbit regardless of its quality.  So they milked the movies for every dollar they could get and didn't care what they had to sacrifice.  It's quite disappointing because, in my view, the story of The Hobbit resonates much more strongly with the average person than The Lord of the Rings, but sadly, we didn't get to see that on the big screen and who knows if we ever will.",1436140800,"07 6, 2015"

"I love this show, it was never in reruns so when it came out on DVD I was stoked! I watched this show every week when it was on the air and who didn't want to be Doris Day living in San Francisco in a Fab apartment working for a hip magazine with a wardrobe change in every scene.The show went through several changes over the five years it was on. Season 1 and 2 Doris is living on her Dad's ranch in Mill Valley CA with her two boys, She starts working at ""Today's World"" magazine in season 2. In season 3 Doris makes the logical choice to move into San Francisco with her two sons into a FAB apartment above an italian cafe.Season 4 is where the show really changed. In an effort to change with the times, Doris is now a single career women dating Doctor Peter Lawford and there is an entire new cast at the magazine. She still has the same apartment but she is now a writer for ""Today's World"". This same format is carried into season 5.  There is no real final episode to the series which is the only fault I have with it.  During Season 5 Doris is still dating Doctor Peter Lawford as well as politico Patrick O'Neil.Yes the show is simple and the format change in season 4 is awkward but the outstanding production values (movie quality) and the 70's fashions and sets are great, its simple and funny entertainment of a better time in the history of TV.  Doris never looked better and I still want that apartment, red convertible and unbelivable I Magnum wardrobe.  A must for Day fans.

"Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch ""Trainspotting"", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as ""Requiem For A Dream"", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.Grade: D+PS This is 500 reviews.

"Sean Bean plays his character as if he were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ned-Stark/dp/B008CLI4N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ned Stark</a>'s twin-brother: the religious maniac. He surrounds himself with a posse of psychopaths, and together they romp through 14th Century England killing and maiming the insufficiently churched. This is the period  of the Black Death, which adds atmosphere as well as the title. The opening scenes feature a panorama of decaying corpses and scurrying rats. Corpses are a running theme throughout the movie.There is still one village that is as yet untouched by the plague. Apparently this is due to witchcraft. The protagonist, a young novice, volunteers to guide Bean and his Merry Men to the village, where they plan on capturing the village chief and embarking on the usual rape, pillage, and so forth. The twist is that the village is more than ready for them when they arrive. Without spoiling too much, its as if the gang had been transported through time and space to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summerisle/dp/B00005KHJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summerisle</a>.  I'll leave it at that.It's a well-done movie. The atmosphere of a countryside bewildered by, and under siege from the plague, is palpable. It's a bit like The Seventh Seal in that regard. Bean is quite believable as a inwardly tortured but outwardly fanatical heresy-hunter. (I did, however, fully expect him to announce ""winter is coming"". I couldn't shake Game of Thrones.)Unfortunately, as others have noted, the rest of the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The guileless adolescent novice remains a guileless adolescent novice, even with the forced twist at the movies end. That is my second criticism. Cinematically speaking, the twist at the end of the film doesn't add much to the experience of the film. The kid turns out to be a witless schmuck, just like the rest of 14th Century society. I suppose that the coda's saving grace is it denies Eddie Redmayne any claim to heroism...which, I guess, is kind of the point of the film.When visited by something as horrific as the black death, no amount of flailing will suffice. Chances are you're not getting out alive.There is a fair amount of arterial spray in the film. Not something for the squeamish, but then I doubt the squeamish would acquire something called ""The Black Death"". For the rest of us, it's nothing we haven't seen before.The throat-cutting, eye-gouging, beheading, caving in of heads, disembowelment, dismemberment, death by torture, etc. are integral to the film and thus have substantive artistic merit.",1351036800,"10 24, 2012"

"I had really been looking forwards to this film, while I enjoyed Batman Begins, I found that there were problems with it, which I had  thought would be remedied with this film. Coupled with the hype sorounding The Dark Knight I thought that I would be in for a treat.Instead I was tremendously disappointed.The Dark Knight  is more like a glorified episode of `The Sheild' or `The Wire', in which a cops and lawyers try to apprehend a psychopath. The movie is more about Gordon, Dent and The Joker than it is about Batman. In fact Batman is hardly in the film at all, and when he is featured there is no depth to his appearance or performance.  In fact if Batman had been taken out of it, or his part replaced with a maverick cop or private eye the film would have not been changed. Batman being in the film had no consequence to the film.  In retrospect the film really should have been called `The Joker' because the film  is more about him than anyone else.Here are some of the problems I had with the film.*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind. Are we supposed to believe that he never came across a psychopath during his travels? I also guess that in the Nolan Batverse we are to believe that Stalin and Hitler and other such monsters never existed. Which is why it explains his complete surprise that someone like the Joker could exist, and his inability to get a handle him.* Batman is supposed to be well versed in the martial arts which above all  else instills discipline and focus. Yet he allows the Joker to needlessly provoke him into loosing his temper, wasting precious time while his  two friends are in mortal danger.* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding. I almost choked when I saw him lecture a cop about not contaminating the crime scene.*The Jokers' success in the film is contingent on most of the characters behaving stupidly and having no common sense.* In Batman Begins, Bruce was committed to being Batman, now in the TDK he wants to throw in the towel and quit at the first sign of trouble.  I would have thought that Batman would have a stronger spine.* Bruce deciding that he can give up being Batman because he now has Dent to take his place. How can that be the case when he and Dent do two completely different jobs? Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals. Dent is a prosecutor who tries criminals, he does nothing to apprehend criminals he has to rely on the cops to do that.* Bruce saying that Dent is his successor despite the fact that Dent already had a bad reputation to begin with. Wasn't Batman supposed to have done research?* Dent's speech at dinner about Batman wanting to give up being Batman someday. How is Dent supposed to have come by this information?* Dent's sudden transformation to Two Face, because of the death of his girlfriend.*If the Joker is hell bent on confusion and destruction and human misery, why is he taking the time to explain to Dent that he had nothing to do with the death of his girlfriend?* The whole scene with the ferry. The notion of a group willing to sacrifice themselves until death for another group of people is unrealistic. Self-preservation is the number one rule of all human beings. Also if people are as self-sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene. Then what do they need Batman for?*Two Face whining about the what's fair, yet trying to justify trying to kill Gordon's family.* The notion that Batman is setting himself up as a sacrificial lamb at the end of the film because 'that's what the people' need is a lame attempt to draw an equation between Batman and Jesus Christ. It was extremely tacky and contrived. Nowhere is it written in any of the Batman books that Batman's  intent is to take the punishment for the people.*The Hong Kong scene was stupid and pointless, as was the useless car chase.And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches. I just found it hard to take seriouslyThis is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.  Clearly Nolan has no understanding or respect for Batman.",1219449600,"08 23, 2008"

"OMG! I am so glad I did not buy this movie. Where do I start? This movie was Godzilla, Transformers, Cloverfield, and other similar low-budget monster movies. The acting was second rate except for Idris Elba, I loved him in Luther, this must have been step down from doing a top series like Luther, to this stinker! Hey, it's only my opinion, but what a let down, I think sometimes the ratings are over blown so you will rent them or foolishly buy them first. Thanks Hollywood, you did it again, with a lack luster bomb, that will probably make millions off of the toys they will make of the creatures, and people will buy them, like the sorry robots in this mess, it is all hype and commercialism, all bark and no bite, you could see something like this on Saturday morning cartoons.",1382054400,"10 18, 2013"

"I snatched this up as soon as I saw it on Amazon thinking it was the latest dvd by the MST3K spin-off group the film crew.The actual dvd features a troupe of comedians that take the long way around getting to the plot concerning murders at a cineplex. After the first murder I'd had enough. I don't like to discourage young talent, but this project is thoroughly amateurish. The script is pretty much one tawdry sexual situation after another. The production desperately needed a make-up professional or at least somebody that could light the performers in a flattering manner. The acting is exaggerated mugging, almost like this had been a stage production and they're reenacting their broad 'to the back seats' performances. All in all, it seemed like a video made to impress their friends rather than something that should be in general release. I can't comment on the second feature since the first one was so unpleasant to sit through.",1211932800,"05 28, 2008"

The images in the first 20 minutes were so disturbing within the first 20 minutes, we turned it off.  Based off the reviews, -and owing to the fact that this is a Disney movie, I thought I'd be safe showing it to my kids.  Watching a corpse's jaw dislocate is not my idea of family friendly.

"An interesting take on psychological versus actual reality. Typically French, but very slow-moving. I guess the subject matter requires a slow paced film to reflect the passing of time.

"WARNING! SPOILERS WILL BE COMING!How my ratings work:5 - I loved it4 - I really like it3 - I like it/Worth a look2 - Don't like it1 - Hate itI'll admit that when I first saw promotional material for this movie and a trailer, I thought ""This couldn't bee too bad."" Course the more I learned about the more it sounded totally moronic. Not helping is that after you really think about it, the killer has the face of an emoticon. OMG! EMOTICONS HAVE GAINED SENTIENCE! RUN!The legend: There's an urban legend on the internet (which just sounds odd to begin with) that if you go onto a random chat room and type to someone ""I DID IT FOR THE LULZ"" three times (when I first read this I felt my brain was gonna pop from the stupid) and a guy named Smiley comes behind the LULZ victim with a knife and I'm sure you can guess what he does next. He's called Smiley because he sewed his eyes shut vertically (and must've had some large eyes or put more effort into slicing his eyes vertically and then sewing them shut) and carved a smile on his mouth. I guess he also somehow sanded off his nose and made his nostrils disappear. This must've looked too graphic for DVDs (but not posters), because on the cover it looks like he's wearing a sack with a smile put on it (which really isn't too bad and could've been creepy), and in the movie he appears to be wearing some sort of smiley face mask with a panty stocking over it (making it look more silly, but I guess the knife helps). Maybe if he wasn't an internet based killer it would be more effective, but horror based around the internet just come off really really stupid. First off, the chat roulette in the movie (called hide and go chat) is outdated by several years, and wouldn't most these days have sound as well?Characters/plot: our main character is Ashley (played by an actress who's name you don't need to learn because I seriously doubt she's gonna have a career after this) who's just starting college. She rents a house with another college student named Proxy (good lord) and it's clear right away that Ashley has never interacted with another human being. She spouts dialogue that just makes you go ""What is wrong with you?"" Example: *Proxy invites her to a party* ""Isn't in a school night? Oh ha, right, it's college I can do whatever I want! heh Yes, I except your invitation."" or when Proxy hands her a joint ""I think I'm high off your marijuana."" Other characters include moron hacker Zane, moron computer nerd Binder (played by a youtube celebrity apparently...wow!), a dull as crud ethics teacher who just rambles on and on and says nothing and actually asks his students what a hypothesis is (funny, I thought that was something you learn in middle school).Ashley and Proxy think it would be hilarious to try the LULZ legend on some random person and get shocked when the person dies. This of course can't be reported because it happened on the internet, therefore the cops wouldn't take it seriously (video evidence, what's that!?). As it turns out the cops don't, as the main cop (played by Keith David, who was also in the amazingly stupid internet based horror film Chain Letter and deserves SOOOOOO much better! The dude was Goliath on Gargoyles for God sake!) says they need a body or for her to know said victims (because people only report deaths of people they know, never strangers).Technical goofs: This movie is filled with so many continuity errors that it's just sad. And anyone who says ""It's a low budget horror film!"" that isn't a valid excuse! There are plenty of low budget horror films that still looked good (which this movie does look ok) and kept decent continuity.Examples:1. The opening kill girl hears about the urban legend from a girl she's baby sitting. Later at home, she goes to a random chat room and some dude with glasses who just loops with his eyebrow arching types it out to her. However, it first shows the screen as her typing it (indicated by YOU), but then shows STRANGER writing it.2. We see said eyebrow looping dude at the party Ashley and Proxy go to, and we see him performing the LULZ and constantly see him looking at his friends and his ""video"" is still of him eyebrow looping or the video isn't on there at all (keen eyes will notice he doesn't even have a cam, built in or otherwise).3. There's a scene where Ashley freaks out and smashes her laptop and someone films it and puts it on youtube (I can't make this up, if I could I'd have written and sold it for a quick buck). When talking to the cops, they show her the video. And you can clearly see the edit option above the video! COME ON! Would it have really been so hard to have them open the video in a different link that didn't feature that? Internet reviewers have better continuity and they have even less of a budget!JUMP SCARES!: Every modern horror films has to have one. Not just a jump scare, but it also has to have that noise of someone banging on what sounds like a metal pan or something. Who needs atmosphere and mood? Let's just catch some people off guard with LOUD NOISES! There is a scene where I DID IT FOR THE LULZ! is painted on a wall in blood!The ending (I gave a spoiler warning at the start, you have no right to be upset by this): Turns out that Proxy and her friends were all messing with Ashley to drive her insane, and it causes her to jump out a window (a really bad CGI window) fall on her head and kill her). They all see this as a win for Anonymous (the online hacking group for those that don't know; Apparently they like to cause people mental grief and kill people) and even the opening kill girl was in on it. NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE! The opening kill girl was all spooked out in her house, plus she heard about the legend from the girl she was babysitting. The chat room thing is random, you have no way of knowing who you're going to chat with and therefore can't set up a fake kill or real kill. Ashley encounters Smiley in a chat room, meaning someone had to be sitting there for most likely days in hopes that she eventually came across him. This whole thing also had to rely on the cops being total morons who wouldn't take her seriously. Then there's the scene where she accidently shoots Binder, who was actually rigged with a squib and she had a fake gun that was placed at Zane's house, where she went to check on him. She could've easily gotten ahold of a real gun, or not even shot Binder and just let him in the house, which would've messed with their plan. And everyone in the group finds it awesome that Ashley was killed; apparently internet geeks are sociopaths. There was no reason for them to be messing with her! Well, other than the fact that they were bored I guess and figured ""Hey, let's prank on this doofy girl! FOR THE LULZ!"" Proxy via webcam finds it awesome as well, but later questions if they're bad people (OF COURSE NOT! You only messed with a girls psyche and caused her to die!) and Zane jokingly types in LULZ and Proxy gets killed by the real Smiley! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN!Everyone in this movie is awful! The acting is either really bad or just really bland. Once Proxy gets all nervous about Smiley, she starts showing up randomly to Ashley in an attempt to JUMP SCARE her and act crazy. The ethics teacher is so droning and bland, and his scenes are pointless and add nothing to the movie! Keith David I suppose isn't too bad, but it's not like he's in the movie long enough to make any impact. And the lead playing Ashley! MY GOD! SHE IS SOOOOOOOO BAD! She is one of the most awkward leads I've ever seen. Did the director not see her audition first? Did he really think ""Oh yeah, she's a natural."" The direction isn't too bad, but the script (co-written by the director) is just incredibly stupid. What is with modern horror films making most of the main characters either bland or just so obnoxious and or jerky that we have no reason to give a crap what happens to them? A good horror film will set up some character development and make them a little sympathetic before killing them off (like John Carpenter's Halloween or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street). This is also a tame horror film for a modern day slasher. I'm not saying gore would make it better, but at least there'd be some entertainment from the killer being over the top in his killings. But no, he just stabs people (sure, that's mostly what Michael Meyers did, but again there was mood set and had presence). That's actually another thing, Smiley isn't really in the movie much. He's mentioned a lot, but he's not around much and there aren't many kills. Again, doesn't have to be a blood bath, but most super natural killers make a show of it. Even Chain Letter had OTT gore. That didn't make it good by any means, but it was still something.So yeah, this movie sucks. I know I rambled, but I wanted to blow off steam on how bad it was.

The movie was beautifully photographed and the sets and costumes were certainly spectacular but it dragged on painfully and turned a very compelling and exciting subject matter into one big yawn.It did however make me want to know more about Marie Antoinette and about that time period and I give it credit for enticing me to buy the excellent biography that it was based on.The soundtrack was also excellent although initially it seems like heresy to use 80s music as a backdrop to a period piece.I give Sophia Coppola an E for effort and a vote of thanks for bringing attention to the book and its subject.,1166572800,"12 20, 2006"
"A rather silly little film. It is in no way love for the city of New York which is hardly explored or presented, except as a hunting ground, but evanescent and transient love in New York. Nothing really regular, only accidental meeting and sexual exchanges that are more at the level of the word, not really courting but rather shocking in order to get the fastest and most comprehensive reaction that has to be sexual action. A couple of situations are funny, but never very kosher and that leads to a mutilated vision of New York with only Jews and Chinese. Rejection of the others and stigmatization of those shown. A film to avoid if possible or to see in order to learn the art of the caricature that means nothing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Crteil, CEGID",1273968000,"05 16, 2010"

"With James Stewart and Spencer Tracy starring together, ""Malaya"" seemed a good bet to be a movie worth seeing.  It is a rather decent movie for its' time but there were some issues I had with its' factual content.  I mention that because the movie does a good job of dealing with an actual issue that existed during the war; the shortage of raw rubber.  If I'm not mistaken, the need for other habitats for the rubber plant (Brazil) and the development (out of necessity) for synthetic rubber, led to the eventual demise of the Southeast Asian rubber market.  However, that came later and, at the outset of WWII, Japanese control of the rubber producing area caused a critical shortage for the US and its' Allies.The objection I had with ""Malaya"" was the cosy relationship that existed in the Malayan setting between the Japanese, the Dutchman, and the Americans.  In case you missed any other clues that the US was already at war with Japan, Stewart's remark about his brother dying at Wake Island ought to have let you know that war was already underway.  The Dutchman, played with his usual excellence by Sidney Greenstreet, was just as much a target of the Japanese as the Americans.  The quick demise of The Netherlands in the initial days in Europe often obscures the role the Dutch soldiers played in the Pacific Theater of War.  So what?  Well, I had the feeling that ""Malaya"" was meant to be a cross between ""Casablanca"" and ""Across the Pacific"" with Sidney Greenstreet, rather than Humphrey Bogart, being the connection between the three movies.  However, this was not a neutral site to those involved and that kept me distracted throughout the bulk of the movie.Other than the probably overstated objection, the movie moves along well.  There's a lot of tough guys in this film including Gilbert Roland playing a person of Hispanic descent made up to look like a Frenchman.  (I guess that confused me as well).  Nonetheless, he did well in his schizophrenic role.Enjoy the movie and not the historical issues.  It's not one of Hollywood's classics by any means but it's still worth a look.",1156550400,"08 26, 2006"
"First and foremost, this is a dull movie.  It starts off slow, it stays slow.  Secondly, it's a chick flick.  It's more a romance/girl-power chick flick nonsense than the advertised ""thriller.""It is impossible to review this movie properly without a spoiler, so there's your warning.  The monsters are poorly done, and the final scenes borrow in a failing manner from ""The Blair witch Project.""  In fact, there are several derivative scenes to the movie.My suggestion, instead of seeing this movie, wear a blindfold next to the percussion practice rooms of your local high school; and tell the drummers to once in a while bang the drum next to your ear.  It'll save you the eight bucks and provide a bigger scare.  Mind you, I hate saying this because the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and it was an attractive looking film.  But it's crap.  The storyline is poor, etc etc.  My inability to convey the junk this movie is in words perturbs me, since I want to try to save thousands of moviegoers the wasted time.

"I saw ""Snake Eyes"" in the theaters a few ago because I am somewhat of a fan of Brian DePalma.  Unfortunately, this movie is one of DePalma's worst.The United States Secretary of Defense is assassinated at a major boxing match and corrupt cop Nicholas Cage later uncovers the conspiracy.""Snake Eyes"" is one of DePalma's worst movies.  The film has one of the worst time-credibility problems that I have ever seen in a movie.  The viewer witnesses the opening of the film, the introduction of the major characters, the assassination sequence, and Cage's lone unraveling of the mystery.  All of these events take place over a period of time less than twenty-four hours.  I couldn't believe that all of these events could take place in such a short period of time and that one lone corrupt cop could uncover an intricate conspiracy so quickly.  In ""Blow Out,"" another Brian DePalma film which also focused on a political assassination, movie soundman John Travolta uncovers a similar conspiracy over several weeks(A much more credible period of time).  The post-climax extension of the story involving Cage's law enforcement career seemed as if it were added on at the last minute and was completely unnecessary.  The viewer doesn't develop any real concern for DePalma's characters in this movie. Cage's sudden transition from cop-on-the-take to do-gooder was also unconvincing.Something happened to Brian DePalma after the 1970s.  After his masterpiece ""Dressed To Kill,""  DePalma has failed to make one genuinely good thriller.  Only ""Blow Out"" and ""The Untouchables"" come close to his original work.  Since ""Dressed To Kill,"" DePalma has largely wandered through forgettable thrillers(""Body Double,"" ""Raising Cain""), plastic Hollywood blockbusters(""Mission: Impossible""), and outright disasters(""Bonfire of the Vanities"").  Perhaps DePalma will make a comeback one day.""Snake Eyes"" is a disappointment.",994636800,"07 9, 2001"

I have watched it by first time on TV when I was a child and I prefere this kind of films instead of the modern ones that have a lot of unnecessary technical resources.

"The Matrix alone was a very confusing film. Had it not been for its visuals it probably would have failed. Who actually remembers what the characters in this movie said (Whoa!)? I don't, but I definately remember the float kick.And then it was announced that two and three were coming out, and I figured the world would be explained a little better. It was, but never to a satisfying extent. In fact, I still remember watching the final movie with a friend and seeing his perplexed look as the credits rolled near.Luckily, I had seen Animatrix before hand, and I knew a great deal more about the movies because of it. In fact, without the Animatrix, I would have been too lost to really care about the second or third movies. Hell, the second movie starts as an epilogue to one of the short films in the Animatrix. And the character of Kid that adores Neo and jumps into a mech in the third film would have seemingly came out of nowhere to those who haven't seen the Animatrix, where he is introduced more thoroughly as a bored kid with a propensity for doing what is needed.The Animatrix also explains the history of the Matrix in two shorts that unfold in documentary form. After watching this, you understand why the machines are so hostile to humanity in the Matrix films. Other shorts explore some of the attributes of the Matrix, going as far as explaining how a haunted house is made. Without this we'd be lost inside the world of the Matrix films.But it's not perfect. At least two of the stories have little relevance to the actual world of the Matrix (though they are still great to watch). The shorts are maybe too short. The quick ten minute films are often a bit jarring, as you're forced into them and back out rather quickly. To add to that, there seems to be too much experimentation in the animation. One is done in what looks to be pencil sketches, one is exaggerated with strange camera angles, another is entirely black and white, and the last film has drug-haze coloring that I still can't stand to watch.I recommend this movie to true anime fans and to Matrix lovers.",1130112000,"10 24, 2005"

"I believe the reviewer, Pirate Queen, has basically got it. I will add a bit more, for what it's worth. The projects that Jonze is involved with represent the most enlightened art in American cinema today, the cutting edge in Hollywood.  One must remember that the mean age of the Friday night eight-plex going crowd is 12 or 13 years old - catering to the caprice of this crowd is the primary basis for so-called ""commercial"" success.  Thus, as public taste is ajudicated statistically at the core of the film-going audience, potential for b.o. remuneration being the primary concern of those who keep such statistics close-by, American film is designed to avoid subtlety, nuance.  Where The Wild Things Are invites repeated viewings. A masterpiece of ensemble character development (the most challenging form of screenplay), the film is a bona fide philosophical commentary of the roots of numerous of the most serious problems confronting us today, sans pretense, or excessive elaboration. I found the film hysterically funny at moments (""... they're in love"", candid, and ultimately ""timely"" in the best sense.And I would like to commend the filmakers for not stooping to animation - the most dehumanizing trend in film. If only the Jonze's of the world held sway over the Wassermans and the Orvitzes then I would at least - feel like a king - if only in the movie theater where even a hint of the wild is so rarely to be found.",1293667200,"12 30, 2010"

"The King and I has been praised deservedly so for many years, both the Broadway run and this wonderful fim. There is too, the non-musical vbersion, Anna and the King of Siam with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison as the King..very good, and interesting in watching the British Empire stuff recede into the background, as Mrs. Anna begins to need the Siamese more than they need he, and here, the king especially. It's on DVD and well worth the purchase.This 1956 musical version has the great Rogers and Hammerstein score and the fabulous Yul Brynner and  radiant Deborah Kerr to put it all together. She is outstanding anyway in any thing, and Yul Brynner and Ms Kerr are dynamite as a couple in this, as they are later on in the very inetersting film, The Journey.I think here it is their collective belief in the material and their respective exhuberance to show us they love this musical, plus their talents, that make the film such a must see.Also, this film was shot in Cinemascope 55(I believe) that greatly enhances all of it, if you habe Big Screen TV.

"I really don't know what to say about this. I was mildly entertained by Tom Goes to the Mayor. It had its funny moments, but it was no great show.This one is just bad. There's really no intended purpose to any of this. It's simply a mashing of incoherent and obscurely done live-action sketches without any jokes, and with attempts at humor which fail miserably. It just seems to be Tim and Eric's attempts to broadcast their obsession with weird noises and things to other people, like the way they like to make noises with their mouths, and dress up and talk like other people (it would be called acting if they were any good at it).I just can't believe how awful it is... it's not even like bad like Tom Goes to the Mayor was, this has nothing in it. No substance. Not once did I ever crack a smile watching any episode of Season 1 (Season 2 had ONE moment that made me laugh... and was soon over).

"Officer Tony Brown chooses to relocate to the small town of Adams in Massachusetts after he gets fed up with all the crime of big city life. But he soon comes to realize that both the local sheriff as well as the townspeople are part of a plan to lead unsuspecting out-of-towners, such as hitchhikers and people with car troubles, into the woods to get slaughtered by scarecrows.This movie has a lot going against it, atrocious acting, slow pacing,characters that are extremely unlikable (for no good reason whatsoever), it's relatively bloodless, and the parts that try (too hard) to add humor are just cringe-worthy. I usually support independent cinema so I gave Geno McGahee a second chance to impress me after the cinematic sludge that was ""Evil Awakening"", but as mind-numbingly awful as that film was, this second attempt is actually somehow worse.",1516492800,"01 21, 2018"

"Loved it! I watched this with my wife and we both greatly enjoyed every minute of this well made movie. At the price point on Amazon ($4.90) this is highly recommend for those who collect Hallmark movies on DVD as a collectible. This movie was originally shot in and presented Full Frame (4:3) when it originally aired in 2006, as such is the correct aspect ratio. It is the best way to view this movie since you will view all the great background scenery as originally filmed. Hallmark Channel has repeatably shown this movie over the the Holidays including this year (2015), but in a cropped widescreen presentation that chops off significant portions of the movie from the top and bottom, likely thinking this pleases the viewers.

"I'm only reviewing this in case somebody has read Robert Horton's review and has made a decision based on what was written. In fact if he hadn't said how great the soundtrack was I would have seriously wondered about his capabilities as a critic. I saw this film when it was released and as yet have not seen the dvd but I saw the film twice in one week and absolutely loved it. I disagree with pretty much everything Mr Horton says. The performances are great and the film carries so much warmth and beauty I find it strange as to what some people want from a 'love story'.I'll tell you where I think the negative reviews come from. The film is ambitious in its' production and was very innovative and some just can't handle that. And people like to pidgeon-hole actors, directors, songwriters, bands etc and probably had a hard time figuring out what Mr Godfather was doing directing a love story. Well that is their problem.If you like beautiful movies this is a must. If you don't your name is probably Robert Horton.",1076198400,"02 8, 2004"
"This is an interesting 1 star show. its weird how it earns one star. in some areas the overall plot is interesting enough. the mysteries that must be solved can be good but other times are solved in terrible super cop syndrome. the show has much potential but just ends up failing. had this show had writers and not monkeys with type writers it would of been gold as the main premise is rather good and a mystery show is rare enough that they can be quite entertaining.that said on with the bad. for starters the characters are basically one dimensional and from start to finish act out exactly how they would from episode 1(or whenever you first meet them) to the finish. despite Ayume helps the blade children repeatedly they all constantly tell him to but out despite dragging him into the mess in the first place. one of the blade children is OCD about another one called Eyes. two of the others are OCD for each other. Ayumes side kick girl is the same annoying person from start to finish and is in love with him from start to finish. to prove she does not change at all. in a later episode where Ayume is depressed she continues to babble on about food(she loves food), walking around and the weather and it takes all day for her to finally blurt out something is wrong with him. he gets stubborn(like in every episode) so instead of proving she cares she simply says to paraphrase the Ayume i know is in there somewhere so when you find him tell him to believe in himself(she says this at least once an episode) and walks away instead of acting like a friend all day she remains the selfish pointless idiot she is from start to finish. She also inexplicably sings some weird song every episode which is called a weird song every episode. the last 6 minutes of the entire Anime is where they finally show mild character changes so sorry that doesnt count as character growth and plot writing.there also seems to be no real reason anyone is chasing the main characters. Ayume or Little Narumi as he is called is chased by the blade children because he is the key to their salvation....fair enough. except that is never answered.why is he the key to their salavation?who is Ayume's older brother that gets mentioned 10 times per episode? despite his rampant repeated mentioning you are not once told who he is or why anyone should care. yet all the blade children seem to worship him as some sort of God or prophet.who are the blade children? this is asked another 10 times per episode yet not once gets answered. at best you discover they are missing a rib....are cursed(what kind of curse goes unanswered)....and have hunters chasing them(again why hunters chase them and what are these hunters gets completely unanswered)also why do the characters tend to repeat similar dialogue and in some cases the exact same words each freakin episode? also why do the characters go through the exact same motions in every single episode?we also then have the last 2-3 episodes which border on idiotic. after yet another trap and series of mazes and mysteries. the blade children confront and kill a hunter after trying to save the hunters life because saving the guy trying to kill you makes sense. as he falls to his death he rambles on about how the blade children are cursed(SHOCKING I KNOW...only the 456345646th time that is ever said in this anime) and how they need to be sent back to the darkness or something. this inexplicably shocks EVERYONE. the next episode everyone is in some sort of depression over this startling revelation which makes 0 sense since they have all said it at least 1000 times per episode. so under what planet is this shocking enough to cause a deep depression by everyone?then we have the ending episode. where Ayume who is sherlock holmes and super cop mixed into one. if youve seen sherlock holmes and watched any cop show in the past 10 years you will know those cops go into super cop mode and make weird psychotic jumps in logical conclusions to get an outcome. Ayume is both mixed into one. needlessly to say there is no mystery or trap he cannot think his way out of. that said at the end after beating the last villian in one last insane maze three plotholes happen1. he escapes and grabs his jacket that he has previously burned into ashes.2, he grabs a giant stuffed animal out of his pocket that goes unnoticed until this point because a giant stuffed animal is easily jammed into your pocket3. when he is free he actually says ""he cant do anything"". SERIOUSLY???? you are super cop + sherlock holmes and even before this final seen manages to make a crazy jump onto a boat leaping at least 3 feet into the air. and you cant do anything? ok yea sure buddy.i will also say i didn't buy the complete series. i bought the indivual DVD cases seperately as they were cheap and on sale. and bought the final two i was missing on amazon. that said there is no way in this seperate DVD cases to tell the order of the discs. you have to look this up online. hey a mystery show with a mystery order on the discs yay.there is also the main menu of each DVD. first there is a two minute unskippable AD to an anime. secondly is the menu itself. which is laid out like this:progressionratiosskewexponentsok what is this? and who it made it and why? i really want to slap the person that made this menu. progression starts the episodes. one of those has to do with audio and subtitles. the other two i don't remember because it makes no sense. speaking of subtitles the first 5 discs have three subtitle options. the last one inexplicably has only two. i watched the first five discs with subtitle option two turned on but for the last disc that option was now subtitle option 1 because why not? i don't know it made 0 sense like this entire anime.from the disc menu(seriously how do you mess up the disc menu????) to storyline to the finish this show fails.",1366243200,"04 18, 2013"

"LILIES, 2007.  In this touching British television series, set in Liverpool, 1920, shortly after World War I, three girls approaching womanhood find themselves in a world on the brink of change. Iris, May, and Ruby Moss come of age in a time when life, for many of their neighbors, is lived on the breadline.  The production was made by BBC Northern Ireland for BBC One.  This original eight-part period drama by acclaimed screenwriter Heidi Thomas, ( MADAME BOVARY, the recent UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS series and the very popular CALL THE MIDWIFE series),  is full of subtly textured period detail and biting modern wit. Catherine Tyldesley, Kerrie Hayes, and Leanne Rowe are the spirited sisters whom their charismatic and overbearing father Dadda Moss calls his lilies. The box set includes all eight episodes on 3 DVDs running approximately 467 minutes. There is also a behind the scenes featurette of 16 minutes, production notes, a photo gallery, and thank goodness, subtitles, for who on my side of the pond can claim familiarity with the Liverpudlian lingo? I received this as a review copy.The family lives in largely Irish-immigrant working-class Liverpool.  As was then and there common, Iris, (Catherine Tyldesley, CORONATION STREET), eldest of the three sisters dutifully runs the household in the wake of the mother's death, as she is expected to.  Second daughter, the beautiful May (Leanne Rowe, OLIVER TWIST) works as a parlor maid but yearns for a less limited life; youngest daughter Ruby (Kerrie Hayes, THE MILL), in the wake of losing her good Post Office job to a returning vet, finds herself selling corsets while she trains to swim in the upcoming Olympics. The family is of mixed religions:  Dadda (Brian McCardie, LINE OF DUTY, ROB ROY), allowed his wife to raise her daughters in her Catholic religion, while he raised his sons in his Protestant religion.  Now the family, including their brother Billy (Daniel Rigby, FLYBOYS), who is shell-shocked, by the war, as they then called what we today call post-traumatic stress disorder, mourns their  mother and a younger brother killed in the war.The costume dramas able actors ensemble also stars, as Mr. Brazendale, Mays employer, Stephen Moyer (TRUE BLOOD); as Father Malachi Melia, the girls priest, Scot Williams (REDIRECTED); as Mrs. Brazendale, Jennifer Hennessy (DROP DEAD GORGEOUS), and as the familys neighbor Frank Gadney, Iain McKee (HOUSEWIFE, 49).  The acting is universally strong, and serious efforts appear to have been made to capture time and place on the screen, in clothing, transportation, interior settings, and outhouses back of the terraced dockland houses.  The episodes are, with thanks to RLJEntertainment:Disc 1Episode 1: The Chit Behind King BillyTo help get the family pianola (player piano) out of hock for a street party honoring war vets, Ruby must take a job selling corsets, while she trains hard for the Olympic swimming tryouts. Brother Billy finds that  all the returning soldiers are not welcomed as heroes.Episode 2: The ThunderboltIris falls in love with a young magician who comes to the door in search of rabbits for his act. The family must face the unpromising prospect of life without her competence and self-sacrifice.Episode 3: The White ChargerAt tea with her employer, Mr. Brazendale, May meets a charming photographer with obvious designs on her. Meanwhile, Billy finds a stray white stallion in the woods; Dadda schemes to keep it for July 12, the centuries old Protestant Orange Parade.Disc 2Episode 4: The TallymanScarlet fever invades the district; the family struggles to provide for seven orphaned children and stay a step ahead of the dreaded housing inspector. But, in secret, May becomes more occupied with Mr. Brazendale's renewed attentions.Episode 5: The SeaNazzer, Billy's best friend from the pre-war neighborhood and the war itself returns, grievously injured, unable to care for himself. Some long-suppressed emotions threaten to engulf  the young men. May discovers that she is pregnant, then discovers that things aren't what she thought they were in the Brazendale household.Episode 6: The ReleaseMay makes every effort to conceal her condition; Ruby takes up with a group of newfound friends who introduce her to such liberating modern ideas as birth control, feminism and vegetarianism. May, however, seeks a different sort of release from her predicament.Disc 3Episode 7: The SerpentBilly inadvertently brings home a snake; a local teacher invites Mr. Moss to discuss the exotic reptile in her class. Their relationship soon turns romantic, to the horror of his daughters. Then, to Daddas horror and rage, he learns of May's condition.Episode 8: The ReckoningAfter a life-threatening delivery, May rejects her baby, to await the return of Mr. Brazendale. Soon the turmoil created by Dadda's drunken flight from the family home, the neighbors' scorn, Iriss pursuit of a vocation ,and Mays vacillations in regard to the Brazendales reaches a climax in confrontation with the upper crust couple at the Brazendale estate.The series, to this American, began slowly, but soon caught me up, as it was evocative, sexy, funny, thought-provoking, heartbreaking. The world in which the three sisters lived was harsh. And as they struggled through bleak poverty and disappointment, they came to realize they must rely on one another-- that their fortunes were bound to each others, their brothers and fathers and that family love was essential to their survival. In the end, I also appreciated the introduction of feminism, suffragist arguments, and yes, vegetarianism, as hints toward a better future.

It's bursting at the seams with fire, explosions, blue skies and sunshine and never fails to excite.Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exhilarating it scorches when you watch it.Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a man on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girl's head as a hat.As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation.Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centerpiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare.

"NOTE: I saw an edited version of this film, with swear words, sex scenes, nudity, and very graphic violence deleted. I can't vouch for the content of the unedited film, and as a Christian I would advise looking into it before viewing this movie. Also, this review will spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet.  2003 seemed to be the year of third installments. We had Return of the King, T3, and then the Matrix Revolutions-at least. I haven't followed every movie out there, so there may have been even more.  So how does Revolutions measure up? After only one viewing I can tell you-it didn't. Which is to say-it was really, really bad. Not only was it one of the most unsatisfactory ends to a trilogy that I have seen, but it was just one of the more poorly made, stupid, and pretentious films in my experience-exceeded only by a couple of other bombshells my family and I walked in to without knowing their lack of worth.  What made it so bad? It wasn't the plot. It had its faults-most plots have some-but better directors could have done more with it. A sketchy form of it is as follows.  The human city of Zion is within twenty hours of being attacked by a quarter million sentinels, the machines' most ubiquitous `soldiers'. The citizens prepare for an attack, and it comes in due course. The humans get the worst of it until one of their own hovercraft gains a temporary reprieve by setting off its Electro-Magnetic Pulse, a weapon that disables all the machines in its blast radius. But the machines aren't about to give up, and the humans know it's only a matter of time before they are attacked again.  Meanwhile, Neo has had some sort of vision or other that he is supposed to go to the machine city. Several people tell him it's suicide to go there, but one of the hovercraft captains who believes in him gives him a ship, and he and Trinity leave. Neo is confronted on the ship by another incarnation of his old nemesis, Agent Smith-but this time Smith has copied himself into someone in the real world. Smith ends up blinding Neo with some laser gun or electric instrument, but the man he copied himself into dies in the encounter.  Somehow Neo can still see, although everything appears to him as orange flame. They reach their destination, where Trinity is killed after their hovercraft crashes. Neo continues his quest despite his grief, and after a talk with the Source, where he makes a deal that, if he defeats Smith, the Source will call off the attack on Zion, he is plugged into the Matrix, where he has a final confrontation with Smith.  A plot like this could have been worked with-although all the stuff about the Source was lame-but the Wachowski Brothers seem bent on making this movie bad.  One of the primary concerns of a movie is acting-a movie is a group of people pretending to be what they are not, caught on camera. Nobody should think of them as true, and no ordinary film maker tries to do so. But a level of realism should be attempted which Revolutions does not achieve. With the exception of Hugo Weaving, who gives a refreshingly professional performance as Agent Smith, and the actor playing the man Smith has `inhabited' in the real world, the rest of the acting is wooden and unconvincing. Keanu Reeves was never any great shakes on the acting score. If he just keeps his mouth shut and fights, he's O.K., and his one-liners are at least indifferent, but when he is forced to handle anything longer, he starts to break down. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is even worse. Her predictably wooden lines are laughable. One has to wonder...did she go to acting school?  Another thing this movie misses is the masculinity of Morpheus in the original Matrix film. Here he is little more than a leather jacket with a pretentious voice, who isn't much of a leader at all any more, at least in the real world. Trinity, who looked up to him before, seems to just ignore him.  Now as to the philosophy of this film. It is even more ridiculous than the acting. Most of it are labyrinthine phrases that are virtually, if not completely, meaningless. Perhaps their intricacies make them sound deep, but this is nothing more than a gaudy chest with promises of treasure on the outside, which, when opened, is empty. No peace, no security, no meaning can be found in the philosophy of Revolutions. The veiled allusion to the crucifixion, when Agent Smith copies himself into Neo and then is destroyed afterwards, when checked against the Wachowski brother's previous record, is blasphemous, not laudable. Nothing Christian here at all-or if it is intended to be, it is the form of Christianity only and not the real thing. There would have been vastly more fruit here if the Wachowski's were Christians.  Even the action scenes get a bit old by the third installment. The new stunts introduced in an attempt to make it innovative were sometimes rather silly-for example, the men of the Frenchman Merovingian have the ability to walk upside-down on walls. Maybe in some movies it could have been effective, but not in this one. Neo and Agent Smith both have acquired the ability to fly-and once again, in some other films this can be effective. Even a movie like Superman, with much inferior special effects, seems to use this better. Perhaps this is merely my bias against the bad parts of this film-which constitutes pretty much everything-but I'm not sure. I'm not going to see it again to find out.  It does seem a good question: ""Why, why, Mr. Anderson, why get up?"" Why indeed? He might have done better just to stay in the mud.",1083196800,"04 29, 2004"

"I hate this cast of actors more than I have ever hated the entire cast of a movie in my life. Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours.",1382227200,"10 20, 2013"

"""I thought there was something special about you. I just don't know what it is yet but I can't wait to find out."" Charlie (Payne) has been chosen to study abroad from his high school. Him, his best friend Ed and ex-girlfriend Amy are in Romania and are excited about the opportunity. When Charlie sees his new teacher (Murray) doing some strange things he tries to convince everyone what is going on. When nothing works he goes to Peter Vincent for help. I wasn't a big fan of the remake with Colin Farrell mainly because I thought the original was fun and more entertaining to watch. The remake just seemed flat and boring. I wasn't all the excited about watching this one because of that reason. Halfway through I was confused as to what this movie actually was. Since it is called Fright Night 2 I was expecting a sequel. This movie is really just another re-make, or everyone has very very very bad memories. The characters are all excataly the same. Charlie, his friend Ed, his ex Amy and TV star Peter (all played by different actors). Charlie sees a vampire...no one belives him...yada yada yada. The only thing different is that this one is set in Romania and the vampire is a woman. Overall, much like Hangover 2, a remake in a different city instead of a sequel.

"""Kung Fu Panda"" is one of the more pleasant surprises to come out of the Hollywood animated film machine these days.  While the Pixar movies are virtual locks for greatness, the rest of the genre has become rather tired, with big name stars lining up for movies designed for max box office appeal rather than great storytelling.So the non-Pixar test these days is, are we watching something more akin to ""Shrek,"" or closer to ""Shrek the Third""?""KFP"" is, thank goodness, right up there with ""Shrek"" in the pantheon of enjoyable animated films not produced by Pixar.  Jack Black is the perfect choice to play Po, the panda seemingly consigned by fate and fat to sell noodles the rest of his life.  But Po's destiny is to be something else- the Dragon Warrior, who shall bring peace to all.Black's comedic timing is on display as he gets virtually all the great lines in this movie, although Dustin Hoffman does yeoman's work as his kung fu mentor, Master Shifu.  This movie essentially wastes other big names who were cast for no apparent reason, as they lend very little to the story:  Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Jackie Chan lend their voices to the Furious Five (a collection of kung fu warriors), but none of these fine actors does anything significant.  Ian MacShane plays the villain as only he can, but in large part this is Black's and Hoffman's show.Very family friendly, with more than a few ""fat jokes"" thrown in (but these are more funny than caustic).  Excellent animation and solid storytelling throughout - this is a very good family film.",1241913600,"05 10, 2009"

"Anyone can say what they want about the individual cartoons in this set, but the fact is, what you're paying for is less than 2 discs worth of the few classic, color, funny cartoons that you actually spent your money to see.  The rest are so obscure that most people have never seven seen them before, and are now clearly being used as filler.  These are the unknown, worthless, un-funny cartoons with unknown characters that WB has never used for anything - ever - other than to now use them as filler to sell DVDs.Golden Collection 1 and 2 were fantasic.  I noticed it slipping a bit with collection 3.  But collection 4 really showed that WB was running out of steam, or at least running out of steam on what they're willing to release.  Collection 5 really confirms it.I know for a fact that there are TONS more cartons that are absolutely fantastic that they could be including but aren't (they're all over the internet).  WB did countless WW2 cartoons as well as many others that SHOULD be included in these sets - after all, the've already got the ""we know these cartoons were racist and biggoted back then, but hey, you grew up with these cartoons so you already knew that"" disclaimer on the discs (WB figured out they didn't have to save face by paying a black spokeswoman to say that).  So they should stop this messing around and release the vast volumes of the GOOD cartoons - politically incorrect or not - from huge vaults that WB is still sitting on.Approximately 1/3 or less of Collection 5 is worthy to take up space in your DVD collection or worth paying for.  The rest of it is worth nothing more than satisfying curiosity of how uninteresting, brainless, witless and BORING cartoons used to be in the beginning (which were originally invented to sell sheet music for musical instruments).Note to Warner Brothers:  if it was made before WW2, please leave it on the cutting room floor.  Pre-WW2 cartoons, for the most part are utterly boring.  If you want to digitize the old fossil cartoons that nobody alive today has ever seen before (or wants to see now) just to preserve them, that's fine, cool.

The movie is made by Eli Roth, and there is no dought he loves the horror genre.  He pulls off camera work and stunts found in Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacure, just to name a few that I remember.  This in no way hurts the film, I say if your going to rip people off....then might as well be from the best in the genre.The story is about a college students, going camping, one gets infected by a flesh eatting virus and then they start to turn on each other for their own survival.  No one is to be trusted, since no one is really safe...infected or not.The movie has a great set up, a great idea, and a great feel to it....the only thing that hurts it is the lame and largly out of place sense of humor found in it.  This is no movie for that kind of stuff.  The horror found it is too dark and the setting too moody.  A feeling of death overruns the film and so there is no place for comedy. The last 10 minutes belong on another movie!!Their are some great creapy parts in the movie (rent this for the shaving scene) but in the end the desire to put in comedy and humor in the blender with all the right ingrendints....makes this one turn out sour and dissapointing.",1075075200,"01 26, 2004"

"This third installment of Rurouni Kenshin is all right, but not great. It has the same good ole humor, but the enemies are very different. The previous episodes tried to be somewhat realistic in their action and events, nothing very magical. In the Meiji Era, though, the events were extremely far fetch, from finding the Elixir to the flow of this huge electic wave of Chi running all over Japan. All strings to reality were chopped off.The Legend of Kyoto had a fantastic ending with a huge, epic battle. Unfortunately, the series never reached the same amount of adrenaline in action. It didn't even come close. I also greatly missed Saitou. I never saw him again after Legend of Kyoto. He made the set of characters perfect with his awesome lack of pity.If you want to keep a good impression of Ruruoni Kenshin, do not buy this DVD box.

"Don't be scared away by the title, ""Bush Christmas"" (1947) has nothing to do with George W. or his father. They are referring to the Australian ""Bush"" and this is a children's film that no doubt was a heavy influence on Nicholas Roeg""s ""Walkabout"" (1971); as well as its source novel by James Vance Marshall. In both a small band of children find themselves in the bush country and out of their element, getting survival tips from a native boy. ""A Far Off Place"" (1993) and ""Alaska"" (1996) also appropriated many elements of the story. ""Bush Christmas"" is the least gritty of the four films but the most believable and the least manipulative.It should remind the viewer of the modern Australian television show ""Saddle Club"" as the kids are around horses all the time; even riding them to and from school. And the plot involves Grinch-inspired horse thieves who almost ruin Christmas for the family when they steal their prize mare, leaving her young colt behind. So the five children head into the bush to track down the horse thieves, while their parents and the police search for them. There is even a Ghost Town (also found in ""Walkabout"") although you have to suspend disbelief when the until now very perceptive children inexplicably take too long to recognize that the horse thieves are its only residents.Worth noting is that Helen Grieve plays the only girl in this group of adventurous children but there is no condescension to her, she rides better than the boys and takes on a kind of ""Wendy"" from ""Peter Pan"" role in the group.Christmas in the southern hemisphere is a summer event but the holiday is still celebrated with winter wonderland decorations, presents, and a tree.Then again, what do I know?

"This is such a boring movie. It's funny though becaues the chance that the person reading this is some LotR nerd who has nothing better to do than go around and say all the 4 and below star rating weren't helpful in their purchase of the movie (even though they probably own it already) is probbly a 90% chance. I fell asleep during all three movies, and I'm a huge fiction/fantasy fan. These have to be the lamest movies ever. Read my sequel of the LotR trilogy if you want to here, [...] I also left a review on MSN if you care enough to go look for it. These are the most pointless movies ever. The concept is lame, the characters are annoying, and the story is dragged out to fullest extent. The hobbits must die, and so must the old wizard guy. I guess I should mention the never-ending ending of the movie. I counted 11 more scenes after I thought the movie was going to end (when Frodo and Sam get picked up by those flying things). I could see 2 or three more scenes, but eleven did it, and that's when I started to openly make jokes at the movie in the theater. What a peice of crap movie.",1083542400,"05 3, 2004"

"Show business legend Bob Hope (1903-2003) began performing for members of the armed services in 1948, and continued to do so for over forty years.  Hope's appreciation and love for America's armed service personnel, was amazing.  Although a labor of love, entertaining the troops involved not only personal sacrifice, but many times called for putting his life at risk in an active war zone, or other dangerous situation.Bob Hope: The Viet Nam Years 1964-72, is a collection of nine of Hope's Christmas specials.  These specials feature excerpts from Hope's performances during the holiday season, at military bases predominantly in the south Pacific, and southeast Asia, and even on various US Navy aircraft carriers.  Hope's troupe would typically include bandleader Les Brown and the Band of Renown, the current Miss World, various novelty acts, and a collection of mostly female entertainers.At the time they were originally aired, these specials were not intended as strictly entertainment, as Hope also wanted to pay tribute to America's military personnel, as well as give those safe and sound in America, a brief view of what those overseas in the military were actually going through.  In his own wonderful way, Bob Hope was doing his best to bring an end to the fighting.Narrated by Hope, the specials have a pseudo-documentary travel log style, as they follow the tour's itinerary from place to place.  They feature a good dose of Hope's topical humor, as well as clips of a few of the supporting acts.  Also included are interesting and unusual events, like recognizing soldiers for their heroism, meeting dignitaries, experiencing enemy gunfire during a show, landing on a carrier, performing in rainstorms, flying to shows with fighter escort, and most importantly, visiting the sick and wounded in various medical facilities.These specials provide just a taste, of what the over two hour long performances were like.  The audiences were often massive, and conditions were usually far from ideal, as Hope, who traditionally opened each performance with a golf club in his hands, and dressed in some wacky military outfit, attempted to provide a little laughter.During the Viet Nam conflict, when some were not willing to openly support America's presence in Viet Nam, Bob Hope and those who joined him on his many USO sponsored tours, bravely lent their full support to the troops, giving their time, enduring hardships, and occasionally putting their lives at risk.  Among those featured in these nine specials are Kaye Stevens, Anita Bryant, Joey Heatherton, Phyllis Diller, Raquel Welch, Ann-Margret, Vida Blue, Lola Falana, Connie Stevens, Neil Armstrong, Jill St. John, Redd Fox, and Jerry Colonna.Each of the three DVD's in the set contains three specials.  Shot under less than ideal conditions, the image quality often isn't the greatest.  Viewing these nine programs in chronological order, it's striking and sadly poignant, how similar they are, as the years pass, while the futility of war remains.  The supporting cast changes, but the iconic Hope remains a constant benevolent presence.  Seeing the troupe repeatedly visiting the same places year after year, and hearing the same jokes about things like the failure of the Paris peace talks, the draft, and the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh trail, even those who never lived through these times, may begin to get some impression of how terribly long the war has dragged on.  Only in the final years, is there happily some evidence of US troops finally being withdrawn stateside.This compilation may rate five stars for content, however it will not be relevant to everyone.  While anyone can probably appreciate the song, dance, and novelty acts, those without some knowledge of these particular times, will not understand most of the topical and political references, and some of the humor will be lost.  While those familiar with this turbulent period in time may be best prepared to appreciate the Bob Hope Christmas specials, most  of the laughter is tempered by the realities of war.  I you do like these specials, you might also take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Hope-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B000UFIYQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Hope Ultimate Collection</a>, although there is some repeat content from this set.Bob Hope was a true friend to almost every American serviceman, and one hell of a good guy.  Memories fade with time, but this set provides a nice reminder of the kinds wonderful things that Hope and his troupe did for so long.  As America continues to maintain a strong military presence around the world, it serves to put Hope's efforts in perspective, as there would seem to be no one today who comes anywhere close to displaying a similar level of support for the military.  Thanks Bob, for so many memories.",1340323200,"06 22, 2012"

"The plot didn't make a lot of sense. The Chinese mafia want to deal Colombian cocaine in Shanghai. They travel to Miami to make a deal with the Colombian cartel. They claim the street value of cocaine is twice what it is in the US. The Colombians balk, ethnic slurs are exchanged. People die. The next thing you know drugs are being shipped to Chinatown in Sydney, Australia via Miami.When a woman is kidnapped, Zheng Liu is hired to get her back. At this point the film becomes a free for all. For some reason Latinos can't work with the Chinese.The acting left a lot to be desired as it is in most drug/crime movies where everyone plays the ultimate tough guy.

"King Kong: 8 out of 10: Peter Jackson's Kong is a long love letter to the original movie that surprisingly turns into that rarest of crowd pleasers. A movie that both men and their gals will like. Like Titanic, Kong has enough action to keep boys of all ages happy and a romance (complete with tragic ending) to get the ladies crying.And what a romance. Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings. And while you may be mumbling Stockholm Syndrome at the beginning (Not to mention whiplash, jeez Jackson turn down the rag doll physics on the Naomi Watts CGI effect. The way Kong flings her around she should end the film in a body cast) the romance seems to win even the cynics (yours truly) at the end.The rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting. Speaking of frightening many people wondered aloud how Jackson would handle the racist caricature (by today standards) of the island natives especially considering the whole disturbing white wizard versus the ""dark forces"" subtext of the LOTR films. Not to worry the embarrassing stereotypes of happy dancing black people are mocked in the Kong stage show putting that embarrassing Hollywood episode to rest.Instead the residents of Skull Island are some of the scariest people ever put on film. Pushing the PG-13 rating to the limit they put the can back in cannibal. It's nice to see natives bashing skulls, going into voodoo trances and kidnapping white woman they invoke the much happier stereotype of the true island savage. Hell they are scarier than the ape.Possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect. While the special effects are overall top notch there are seams. For example when people run with the dinosaurs the limit of the green screen seems to show through (And could we get a moratorium on velociraptors in movies. They are really getting clich and being a relatively new paleontological find really don't fit in a thirties era Kong movie. Yes I know that isn't logical but they kind of seem modern as if a character had a cell phone).The other real problem is length. This feels like the directors cut. With an easy 30 minutes of film that could (and probably should) end up on the cutting room floor. We spend so much time in various Kong free Broadway theaters one might mistake this for a Yankee Doodle Dandy remake. All that said great action scary islanders and tragic romance make King Kong a winner.",1258761600,"11 21, 2009"

"I am a huge fan of Shakespeare.  I have listened to audio versions of all of the plays and have seen stage productions of more than half of them.  The Tempest is on my favorite plays.  Helen Mirren is one of the greatest actresses of our times and I was excited to hear that she had been cast as Prospera.It was so promising!  Unfortunately, the actual film is a total disappointment.  This is one of the worst productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen.The story is set on an island.  The story offers the perfect opportunity for lush tropical settings.  The producers of this film must have searched high and low for a particularly uninteresting area of coastline.  Visually this film is very dull and unappealing.I've seen better staging in a theater.  The Tempest is about magic.  The staging of this film is unimaginative.  There is no magic in the production, making the story pointless.I generally have no problem with Shakespearean language or with British accents.  And yet I had huge issues comprehending what the actors were saying in large sections of the dialog in this film.  Quite a few of them sound like they are mumbling.Unfortunately, this is the kind of dreary production that turns people off of Shakespeare.  Watching this left me sad and disappointed.",1326672000,"01 16, 2012"
"I've always been a Lost in Space fan. From the days when I was very young when Mr. Keema scared me when he revealed himself, to rediscovering it in the late 80's to watching it now for ""warm fuzzy"" memories, the show has always entertained me. At my younger age, I loved Season 2. As a teen, I loved Season 3 and now, I find that Season 1 was simply the best.Season 1 opens with 5 dramatic and suspenseful episodes that rival some of the best sci fi / adventure stories out there. While this isn't ""good"" science, it is fun. Lost in Space rarely, if at all, came close to the adventure and true danger shown in the first 5 episodes of season 1. They go from nearly being killed in an asteroid belt, to almost destroyed by the Robot and ultimately fighting the elements on a strange planet. I won't go in the ""science"" of the show because it wasn't good and logic and continuity (what happened to the dog they found?!?!) were not closely followed. This show was about a close family and their adventures in outer space. Period.Lost in Space started out as a serious survival story and most of the first season deals with that. Despite a road bump with ""Welcome, Stranger"", the first half of Season 1 was very dramatic in its impact. The family had to find food, shelter, water at the same time as battling the unknown and sometimes hostile creatures. Then, the show takes a lurching turn with The Sky Pirate and rarely looks back. From that point on, the main focus of the show was ""comedic villain"" of the week and how Will, Smith and the Robot deal with the issue with Dad coming to the rescue most of the time.Despite the format change, the remaining first season episodes still had a lot of charm and excitement to them. ""All that Glitters"" shows a remorseful side of Smith that we rarely see. ""Follow the Leader"" is one of the best ""alien possession"" episodes of the series. And the ""Magic Mirror"" has a very surreal mood that the series never approached again.The cast was generally consistent in their performances. Guy Williams was solid, Angela Cartwright (when given a good story) could melt your heart, and June Lockheart was one of the best TV moms. Who know that Jonathan Harris' Dr. Smith would become one of the most memorable characters in television history?Season 1 doesn't feature anything in the way of interesting extras. We do get the unaired pilot which is only interesting in the fact it has no Robot or Dr. Smith. The rest of that pilot was cut into most of the first 5 episodes. The back and white quality of the DVD's is crisp and excellent.Lost in Space will always have a place in my heart. Each season of the show had its own unique personality. Season 1 was about survival and adjustment to their situation and it is the very best of the three season series.",1121990400,"07 22, 2005"

Great video my 2yr old grand daughter just love it !!,1446249600,"10 31, 2015"
"This is a big summer for me, because my two tippy-top favorite Disney girls, Ariel and Tink (despite the fact that I really go for the Alice and Wendy performers the most at the theme parks), are getting very special DVD releases; direct-to-video prequels, to be specific. The first is out now, sometimes referred to as The Little Mermaid 3, but released as ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"".The plot of this all new, thankfully traditionally animated feature (unlike the upcoming Tinker Bell CGI movie, though that one still looks good), involves King Triton's tragic loss of Ariel's mother, Queen Athena (And yes, we do see Athena in the film, and she looks more like Ariel than one would probably have imagined), and the way the entire kingdom is soon forced to suffer as he does. King Triton places a ban on all music in the kingdom of Atlantica, because music reminds him of his lost beloved, and this results in ten years of boredom and misery for Triton's subjects and his own seven lovely daughters. After that flashback, narrated by Sebastian the crab, we catch up with Triton and his family sometime during Ariel's fifteenth year, when an encounter with a new fish friend named Flounder leads her to discover a secret, underground club in which music is played and celebrated nightly. Ariel's curious and excitable sisters soon join her on her visits to the secret club, and this is their undoing. For their governess, the scheming Marina Del Ray, is out to get Sebastian's job, and that means she's out to get Sebastian, who just happens to be the illegal, musical nightclub proprietor and head entertainer. It's a rather simple plot about how music was brought back to the kingdom of Atlantica, which isn't a spoiler if you've seen the original film at all, with a mild villain thrown in for a little danger. Marina does turn out to be a threat, but the real hurdle for the heroes in the film is Triton and his anti-music agenda.""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" is definitely a film that walks the line of great and disappointing probably more than any Disney sequel. It's beautifully animated for the most part, with my only real complaint being a few scenes of some significant music box figures done in CGI that looks unfinished in close-ups. The plot is not too shabby, but probably too simple to meet most adult viewers' hopes and expectations (yes, there are tons of adult Disney fanatics out there, like myself). Disney tends to aim its direct-to-video films more squarely at kids than its usually MUCH better bigscreen outings or even its animated TV shows. I consider this to be part of the problem with Disney's line of direct to video releases. Also, the villain of a Disney film is often the best aspect for most folks, and in this case, Sally Field's Marina Del Ray is a good character played beautifully, but not all that important as a villain and certainly not very imposing. She has a creepy pack of electric eels to increase her danger quotient though. Of course, she also has a comedic sidekick, a manatee named Benjamin (who seems to not require much oxygen), who I found a bit annoying really but others seem to enjoy.The biggest problem with the story and the film itself though, for hardcore Little Mermaid fans anyway, is probably that it is hard to buy as a precursor to the original, classic Disney masterpiece. And don't get me started on how annoying it is that the direct-to-video prequel and sequel present Ariel's life as having 10 years of misery and deprivation in her childhood years and ten years of misery and deprivation at the start of her marriage. I know Anderson's mermaid was a tragic character, but this is the most internationally beloved Disney princess of them all! That's beside the point though. As I was saying, it is a bit hard to buy these events as having led up to the original film, and I consider the Disney animated TV series, which I suppose is no longer considered canon (though it is to me), to be a much better prequelization. Something that increases that feeling is the problem ""Ariel's Beginning"" had with character continuity. First, there's the issue of voices, most noticeably, King Triton's (though Ariel's sisters sound totally different from in the theatrical film too). Jim Cummings has taken over as the voice of King Triton after years of Kenneth Mars playing the role. Now, Jim Cummings is a Disney treasure, but he doesn't sound like Triton much at all, and it just doesn't work for me. In fact, of the two biggest complaints I've read about the characterizations in ""Ariel's Beginning"", that's one of them. The other is the character of Flounder. He is a completely different character in this film. Flounder, the cowardly ""guppy"" of the classic film and TV series, is presented here as a Baloo/King Louie wannabe with a rebellious streak. The saddest part is that the one scene in which he really acts just like the original Flounder can be found in the deleted scenes section.But let's talk about chicks, man. Specifically, Ariel, the girl of my dreams, and her six hottie sisters. Ariel is voiced perfectly here by her original voice actress, Jodi Benson, whose voice is still straight from Heaven. And, thankfully, Ariel is totally in character in this movie. Her sisters finally get some decent screen time too, and I gotta tell ya, the exposure we get to Ariel's sisters here is one of the biggest strong points of ""Ariel's Beginning"". I came away from it absolutely adoring Arista.Not a hot female, but also reprising his role perfectly here is the great Samuel E. Wright, who voices Sebastian the crab. Mr. Wright actually performs the most memorable song in the film, which unfortunately is not one of the new, original songs written for the film, but instead is the well-known ""Jump in the Line"". This song is performed twice in the film in two different ways, and it's the best musical aspect aside from Ariel singing ""I Remember"". Sadly, the original songs here are not very memorable. This is usually a problem with direct-to-video animated films that attempt to be musicals, and a prime example of a mistake frequently made is the villain's song here, ""Just One Mistake"", which attempts to emulate the song sang by Ursula in the first film but instead is just all over the place and fails to establish a catchy tune.So, when all is said and done, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is a visually impressive, mildly entertaining new story about Ariel and her friends that unfortunately holds to very little character/story continuity and feels more like it takes place in a parallel universe rather than in the same one as the original film (and totally, disappointingly disregards the TV series; I hate it when they do that!). Honestly, though I still need to rewatch and review it (haven't seen it in a while), I'd be just as comfortable tossing ""The Little Mermaid 2"" into that parallel universe too. I don't care to see Ariel having another 10 years of sadness, nor do I care to see her married to anyone other than me, or with a kid I didn't sire. *ahem*Folks who simply don't feel we need new stories about the Disney princesses shouldn't bother to watch or review this film, but for those of us who do, we would love to see more if they had this level of visual quality but were just written better. Of course, it is said that this is to be the last of the Disney direct-to-video prequels and sequels (we'll see about that), the Tink movie being more of a Fairy franchise thing like the Barbie DVDs, but the real problem was never the concept of making such films, it was just how much work, heart, talent, and of course money was put into them. ""Bambi 2"", despite the uninspired title, remains the best of the Disney animated sequels (aside from ""Rescuers Down Under"", of course) and is really an outstanding film with only the flaw of some all-too-modern sounding songs. ""Ariel's Beginning"" was one of the ones that came close to that level. Visually, it is beautiful. As a stand alone film, it's pretty good/enjoyable. Good enough for me to give it four stars. It just disregards too much of what has already been established as part of Ariel's universe, and writing down for a younger audience is never really a good thing. If they didn't have to do it for the bigscreen films, why do it for the direct-to-video ones? Is it worth a purchase though? Yes, unless you just hate Disney sequels. It's a good film that looks gorgeous on DVD (it's anamorphic widescreen, by the way). The continuity issues may make you mad, they may not, but it's a good film, and truly the real highlight is getting to know Ariel's sisters better. The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, song selections, a short behind-the-scenes featurette with the director, Peggy Holmes, a personality match game (I got Ariel, no cheating!) that is part of a bigger interactive experience that teaches you more about Ariel and her sisters by letting you explore their individual vanities, and the best extra is a behind the scenes look at the new ""The Little Mermaid"" Broadway musical, which I'm DYING to see. A couple of the sisters in that one are cuties too. If you're a fan of Ariel the Little Mermaid, yeah, it's a must purchase.

"If you read lukewarm reviews of this film, ignore them; they were just blowback from Pearl Harbor.  Apparently (I've not seen Pearl Harbor), there are some surface similarities between the two movies--the WWII setting; two friends who are a fliers; a shared love interest--and I suppose that scenario could be considered cliched, but it seems as if critics, who uniformly hated Pearl Harbor, were unwilling to judge Dark Blue World on its own merits.  Their reviews are mostly petulant complaints about having to sit through a Czech version of the prior Hollywood flop.The fascinating story here, based on historical events, involves a veteran Czech pilot, Franta (Ondrej Vetchy), and a fresh-scrubbed young farm boy, Karel (Krystof H&aacute;dek). >As this too simple description suggests, there's ample ammunition here for critics who wanted to dismiss the film as cliched.  But what it's not possible to convey here is how affecting the film is, especially the great love portrayed, which as in all war movies is not the physical love between Franta and Susan but the comradely love of Franta and Karel, who share so much, but ultimately too much.  And the point is that their relationship works and it draws us in.  They are very likable--the one eager and innocent; the other more experienced and reserved.  They're something of an odd match but we can see what they provide to one another, especially in such trying times.  We care about them.  We ache when they hurt each other.  We want them to patch things up.  We feel ennobled by the sacrifices they make for one another.  We can fathom how beautiful yet painful Franta's memories must be to him and why they would remain so close to the surface of his mind.  Indeed, Ondrej Vetchy is especially good as Franta, with his soulful, mournful eyes and the rare gravity he brings to the character.  By the end of the film he's experienced so much loss--to the Nazis, to the Communists, of his friends, of lovers--but there's still a calm dignity that compels our attention and earns our respect.We're a couple years on now and maybe folks have forgotten about Pearl Harbor.  Heck, I don't think anyone saw it but the critics anyway.  So pick up Dark Blue World and watch it for itself, not in order to compare it to some other film.  It is a lovely movie.GRADE : A",1030147200,"08 24, 2002"
"Waiting was a pleasant surprise.It's certainly filled with crude humor, but it manages to be funny anyhow. My first job was in a restaurant much like Shenaniganz and perhaps that's why I found the movie so worth watching.The game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on. If you're a rude anus of a customer, don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will. It pays to be polite and tip well, especially if you are a regular.Chi McBride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great, and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus.All in all, based on personal experience, the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan's Steak House. Sure, the characters are over the top, but they are based on people just like some I've known.If you're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you won't want to see this movie.",1158624000,"09 19, 2006"

I remember seeing it with my mother when I was maybe 10 and it freaked me out. I always remembered it and wanted to see it again, so I bought it and watched it. My only mistake was that I watched it very late at night and by myself! That was a little unnerving and I wouldn't do that again. You would think at 60 years old that wouldn't bother me, but it did!

"Although often touted as a horror comedy, the most amusing aspect of this 1997 direct-to-video clunker is the fact that it is often confused with its saccharine family-flick namesake, a commensurately clunky and similarly themed Michael Keaton vehicle released in theaters the following year. Interestingly, the titular character of each film is a snowman that has somehow come to life. However, those planning a nice evening with the youngsters will be in for quite a shock if they purchase or rent the wrong movie. The snowy dude in Keaton's film is a benevolent father figure who wants to help out his real-life family; the icy hombre in the 1997 horror flick is animated by the soul of an escaped convict with a penchant for rape and murder.Outside of the amusing thought of 1997's JACK FROST getting an accidental showing at a kiddie party, this film has very little to offer. The special FX are amateurish, the script is so inane that it is nearly impossible to suspend one's disbelief for the duration, and much of the acting is horrid. While some films can be admired for their cheesiness--Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD (1981) comes immediately to mind--JACK FROST falls way beneath even THAT standard. Writer-director Michael Cooney seems unable to decide if he wants to spoof the horror genre--there are scenes that mimic horror cliches but few, if any, that parody or satirize them--or simply make, a la Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984), a scary film with humorous characters and an amusing premise. The film vacillates between both styles without gaining sufficient footing in either, and the result is a slushy thematic jumble that is neither scary nor entertaining.JACK FROST is not without a few near-redeeming qualities, however. There are lots of amusing Python-esque puns and jokes sprinkled throughout the film, the kind of verbal gags that make you simultaneously chuckle and...well, GAG. And this film also marks the cinematic debut of gorgeous actress Shannon Elizabeth, who here has some, ah, revealing moments with the eponymous snowman. Unfortunately, these elements do not elevate the film enough to make it worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of one's life.Don't be fooled by the artwork on the DVD's packaging--that cool skull made of snow does not appear in the film. In truth, 1997's JACK FROST is an ice-cold stinker that few discerning horror fans will want to add to their collections.",1168214400,"01 8, 2007"

"I am usually a Disney fan, though my childhood is long past; but this film was a huge disappointment. In my opinion Disney films are at their best when they appeal to both children and adults, but ""Pocahontas"" is more a children's story, despite its serious topic.Pocahontas and John Smith - a true story, which is unfortunately not truthfully told here but audaciously idealized. (As far as I know, today's Indians protested quite a lot about this interpretation of the first clash of the American natives with the Europeans).In the film, after a few difficulties both races make up and learn to get along; the two lovers have saved the situation paying by renouncing on a life together. The fact that the Indian tribes were for the most part slain and wiped out during the following centuries is of course elegantly hushed up.It is also very nave and not believable that Pocahontas and John Smith immediately learned to communicate with one another despite their different languages, only due to ""the power of love"".That Pocahontas in the end gives up the man she loves to stay with her people with the flimsy excuse ""They need me here"" never convinced me. (Also, in the sequel Journey to a new World"" she does travel to England after all.)The ending of the film sees John Smith being brought back home by ship because he has a deep bullet wound and the Indian shaman does not know how to help him. How is a badly wounded man supposed to survive the journey across the ocean, which at the time took at least a month?Apart from this I also couldn't overlook the manual shortcomings: this film's drawings are wooden, there is no comparison to the grace of ""Beauty and the Beast"", the tempo and colourful style of ""Aladdin"" or the superior technique of ""The Lion King"". The music is insignificant except for the epic song ""Colors of the Wind"", which unfortunately remains second rate because the film's actual leitmotif is If ""I Never Knew You"" (this song was not even included in the first edition of the film - it was heard only in the end credits - and added in one of the later editions).Also, my impression was that the film did not really have an arc of suspense, the conflicts ending where they seemed to climax at last with Pocahontas interceding for John Smith before her father.The only remarkable detail ""Pocahontas"" offers is the fact that it lacks one of the main attributes of Disney films - the happy ending.To round up this film, I would recommend watching ""Journey to a new World""; I usually dislike sequels but in this case I felt like it brought a satisfying and credible ending to a story that didn't say much in the first place, at least not to me.",1391040000,"01 30, 2014"

"MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a magnificent piece of filmmaking. The acting is superb, the historical details almost totally accurate, and great special effects.The story revolves around Capt. Jack Aubrey and his crew aboard the British H.M.S. Surprise. It is 1805 and Napolean is conquering the world and now the seas. Aubrey's orders are to intercept the French ship Acheron and either destroy it or capture it. The Acheron surprises the Surprise twice and Jack vows it won't happen again.  Along the way we see the perils of life at sea and the comraderie (and sometimes displeasure) between the sailors.Peter Weir hasn't made a film since THE TRUMAN SHOW and it is a delight to watch his latest achievement.  The movie is strongly story driven. However, unlike many films, the characters aren't underdeveloped.  We get a real sense of the lives of many of the shipman and we grow to like them.  There were two points in the movie where most of the audience sighed in shock as tragedy betook beloved characters.  Also, the musical score is beautiful and seems perfect for a sea-adventure film such as this.I haven't read the books (yet) so I can't say how true to the spirit of the novels the movie is.  However, I can say MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is one good yarn worth watching on the big screen at the theatre.",1069113600,"11 18, 2003"

"This film could've worked as a pure drama or action or horror movie or whatever, but it fails horribly as a docudrama.  They take way too many liberties with the fact-- I mean, we all lived thru the great Alien invasion of '97, we know what Aliens are really like and how they are repulsed.  Hell, they didn't even have ships when they invaded us.  They just used their wings.  Hell, the aliens in this one didn't even *have* wings.  And everyone knows that real aliens use their hyper-advanced xeno kung fu to kill humans, not poison gas.  And they're repulsed by silver, not tap water, unless that tap water has an unusually large amount of silver in it, which is usually doesn't.  Furthermore, they never even explained how the Aliens actually loved us and came in peace, but they express affection thru murder so we didn't understand and it was all a big misunderstanding, until we fixed it and now we all live in peace with the aliens.  Remember that?  I mean sure, I could accept this movie if there were no alien invasion back in '97, and if we had no concrete evidence as to how aliens behave, or even if they exist.  Then you can have them behave however you want, because as a fictional creation there are no rules, and no reasons to believe the creatures would behave anyway in particular.  In fact, I would even say it would be completely moronic to claim that the aliens in this behaved in an unbelievable manner if we knew absolutely nothing about aliens.  But since we do know all about aliens, this is very major, central concern in the film, which completely kills it, as a matter of fact.",1136332800,"01 4, 2006"

"""Master of Disguise"" features ex-Waynes World and SNL member Dana Carvey as an Italian waiter Pistachio Disguisey, whose families have long been protected the world from evil using the art of disguise.  Pistachio himself is not aware of this family secret until one day his father and mother are kidnapped by a megalomaniac villain Devlin Bowman.The story above is nothing but an excuse for showcasing the impersonations by Dana Carvey.  He disguises himself as George W Bush, Al Pacino (Latin version), and a cherry pie.  Surely some of them are funny at first, but many adult fans soon find him irritating or even pathetic.The reason is that you cannot make movies in this way.  The film is only 80 minuites, and that includes very extended end credits including deleted scenes and outtakes.  This fact betrays that the film is too thin in contents, but they should have known that from the first.Of course, kids might think it is funny (and it is notable that the film collected more than $40 million in USA alone, which is a considerable figure).  But think this way.  The opening scene of the film has Bo Derek (yes, that's her!) as a cameo.  I don't think that kids would get it (not many of them recognize her).  SO, for whom is this film made?Carvey impersonating Robert Shaw (from ""Jaws"") is certainly funny, and he is good at it even though the gag would fly over the head of the kids, who would rather prefer ""Turtle Guy.""  And many adults in turn would find it very ... boring.The film is based on a misguided idea -- impersonation, which means playing someone else.  Dana Carvey should have found his own voice first.  Like Mike Meyers who found in Austin Powers; like Harrison Ford in Solo and Indie; like Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels and dangling hair-gel.  Without a good character you cannot sustain the whole 80 minutes and the audiences' attention.  Impersonation is alright as long as you do it in your own way.  Now see TV shows, and many non-professionals do pretty good impersonations.  But Mike Meyers created Austin and Dr. Evil which none of them could not produce.You see supporting cast such as Brent Spiner (Data of ""Star Trek"") and Jennifer Esposito.  They are sadly wasted, both in a very embarrassingly underwritten role.  And the cameos like Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, and Jessica Simpson do not help at all.I know Dana Carvey underwent several surgeries in the past several years before making this film.  I know my review would sound harsh, but you cannot send a wrong message, saying that this is very funny.  It is not.  His fans should see his earlier film ""Opportunity Knocks"" he made about ten years ago, instead.  That is not a masterpice, but far better and enjoyable.",1070236800,"12 1, 2003"

Raj won't stand up for his best friend, and Penny is becoming more expedient and, like Bernadette, willing to let people suffer by using drugs they make and sell, knowing that some are deadly. Leonard is the only one who seems to still have a conscience, a heart and a sense of decency. Too bad that the writing has gone so far downhill.",1442707200,"09 20, 2015"

"""Extinction"" started out very strong and so was the latter part of this film in the middle of the movie, I felt that the writer should have stuck to survival and zombies in stead of boring me with two men fighting over one women who died during the zombie apocalypse( I simply grew bored). I like the fact that they added the little girl in the movie she was great but the men fighting was out of place in this movie. Towards the end it started to pick up again STRONGLY the audience should've had action pack through out the film like the beginning and end.  I hope the third movie they make will be one action, action, and more action until the end just a little slow pace but not half of the movie please.  Other then that pretty decent!This kind of reminds me of the first movie ""Extinction"" it picked up during the beginning and started to slow down tremendously, and fail to deliver a strong ending in the closing of the movie. Again this was better than the first one but still needs some improvements.

"Tripe- what remains when the good stuff is gone. Usual Suspects is Hollywood mannerism at it's worse and naturally most successful. On the heels of the gangster nouveau, it has more twists and turns than Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction put together and characters who are all bad ALL THE TIME -- ""real"" tough guys. And the only thing they fear is Kaiser Soze.Yeah right...Why would anyone be afraid of a guy who killed his own family? Every-time his enemies turn up he kills someone he loves?! Who's gonna work for a moron like that!? The only thing to fear is that you might be related to him!...All the rest is talk-talk, bang-bang, and not even a kiss-kiss. Light and witless fare at best.In fact, what we have here is a series of gratuitous plot-twists and contrivances, abunch of Actors that are all pretending to be tough guys, and a writer and director who sold a bill of goods on a trend started by two movies that Hollywood never wanted to make: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Yeah, you can hear the pitch now: ""it's more Reservoir Dogs than Reservoir Dogs is! More twists and turns than Pulp Fiction!""OSCAR TIME!Except that RD and PF weren't about twists and turns, or tough guys, or Kaiser Snoozy (oh wait, wasn't he in Snow White?). ""The Usual Suspects"" makes the mistake most Hollywood studio flicks do: they confuse the elements of a successful movie with the movie itself. You might as well say Citizen Kane was about the newspaper business, or 2001 was about spaceships, or The Fountainhead was about architecture, or King Of Kings was about carpentry! Worse, once you get the formulae down it becomes just too ...predictable: here we go, another thrilling plot twist!  HEY, SOME OF THESE MAKE MONEY, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T [LACK CLASS] DOING IT.Really, did anyone NOT see that last ""twist"" coming?...OSAR TIME!They loved it! How could they not?

"This is Tarantino and you know it about 40 minutes into the movie. Which is not as quick as one would want, the movie begins with a really drippy ""romance"" between a floozie and a (pathetically mis-cast) Christian Slater. Based on the idea of the underclass conquering the powerful bigshots the film sees two nobodies dice with death, to find their dream in paradise. Fair enough theme.But trust QT and Tony Scott to make a wannabe mess of that theme, just in the interests of making a doozie. The movie has moments that feel like you are watching Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, which thus give you a glimmer of hope for something worthwhile to come, but that bit comes in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie when the plot finally begins -- drugs, shootouts, a zonked out Brad Pitt  etc, with about 60% of the F-words completely unnecessary.Then there are gaping WTFs. Christopher Walkern, a Sicillian honcho simply vanishes after a cooldude scene with Dennis Hopper. Difficult to see how that fit into the scheme of things other than some pseudo-cool dialogue that carries the sophistication of ""your mama"" jibes (literally.)Towards the end, we are supposedly meant to enjoy the vicious beating up of Patricia Arquette at the hands of Gondolfini, much in keeping with the gore fest that Tarantino is associated with. Thank you, have a nice day. Next.There's so much insufferably maudlin stuff about Elvis, it made the movie come perilously close to a run-of-the-mill chickflick.Finally, Tony Scott has his photographer shoot with the usual irritating filters, back lighting and blacked out faces presumably because Jeffrey Kimball felt that if you have one photographic idea in fifteen years it's got to be worth repeating.The point is, as it usually is in a typical QT self-contradiction, that you wouldn't want to meet these characters on the street, but these are simply created for online entertainment in our little bizarre modern fairytale.

"The newest installment by Marvel leaves much to be asked for.  The graphics were pretty good, but at times it looked too fake, such as when Mr. Fantastic catches the fireman and we have a view from below of him.  The storyline itself is decent, although a bit forced.  And the acting was merely okay.Some parts of the plot are of need of improvement as well.  For example, Mr. Fantastic says that he ran out of things to test the electrical storm on and would have to use himself.  Yet, the suits they were all wearing have the same molecular structure as whoever was wearing it at the time, so why not use them before sacrificing yourself?  Perhaps for dramatic effect, but stuff like this pokes holes in the plot and leaves more to be desired.I wouldn't recommend to run out and rent it over other movies, but if there is nothing else than give it a go.

I purchased this movie because I am facinated with Mob movies. The movie was good but could have been better.,1444867200,"10 15, 2015"
The word Amateur is really not strong enough of an adjective to use to describe this really terrible attempt at a movie.  Just junk and a total waste of time....the one saving grace is that you won't waist much time since it starts out bad enough that you will make good use of the fast forward.Nice cover but Don't let it fool you!!!!!!!!  This it TRASH!,1279929600,"07 24, 2010"

"This movie does not get the credit it deserves for being more of a pioneer in the genre than ""Black Christmas"" or ""Halloween"". It's not perfect, but it's a moody, depressing, atmospheric film that was filmed in 1972 when cinema sleaze seemed to be at its peak with great trash like ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Last House on the Left"" hitting midnight theaters and drive-ins.The story revolves around the sale of a gothic old house by the original owner's mysterious grandson. It's a house of secrets that the citizens of an old New England town would like to see destroyed forever. But what secrets of their own are these people hiding and who would like to see them die?I only knew Mary Woronov as the bitchy prison matron who sprayed down ""Charlie's Angels"" for lice and bugs in 1976, and her performance here as the so-called ""final girl"" isn't as fun or campy. She also seems much younger and softer here.Still, a lengthy, creepy flashback sequence that looks like old pre-WWII European stock footage (featuring Candy Darling and other Warhol ""superstars""), an intriguing storyline, and some shocking gore for its time outweigh a few uninspired performances and some slow spots in the script.The print looks ragged and worn, but the DVD market is oversaturated with public domain releases of this film and a restored version is highly unlikely.If you enjoy early '70s twisted thrillers such as ""Blood and Lace"", ""Private Parts"" or ""Don't Look in the Basement"" this one will be right up your alley.",1319328000,"10 23, 2011"
This was basically a movie about a guy sitting around looking at old video tapes and scaring himself.  Not much drama.  Not much suspense.  Not much of a story really. Not good.,1381795200,"10 15, 2013"
Watched for 5 minutes and aborted.  Below TV movie quality,1513728000,"12 20, 2017"
It was humorous by the unexpected show of skills similar to Bourne identity. It kept my attention through most of the movie .,1473465600,"09 10, 2016"
not bad.,1419292800,"12 23, 2014"
if you want inane and  predictable this is your baby~,1458000000,"03 15, 2016"
